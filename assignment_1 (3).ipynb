      " Through the Postern Gate  A ROMANCE IN SEVEN DAYS    By  Florence L  Barclay   Author of   The Rosary    The Mistress of Shenstone    The Following of the Star   etc    London and New York  G  P  Putnam s Sons              th Thousand    Made and Printed in Great Britain by The Camelot Press Limited  Southampton     TO  MY MOTHER     Contents   THE FIRST DAY  THE STORY OF LITTLE BOY BLUE   THE SECOND DAY  MISS CHARTERIS TAKES CONTROL   THE THIRD DAY  THE BOY INVADES THE KITCHEN   THE FOURTH DAY  CHRISTOBEL SIGNS HER NAME   THE FIFTH DAY  GUY CHELSEA TAKES CONTROL   THE SIXTH DAY  MISS ANN HAS  MUCH TO SAY    AN INTERLUDE   AS A DREAM  WHEN ONE AWAKETH    THE SEVENTH DAY  THE STONE IS ROLLED AWAY     THE FIRST DAY  THE STORY OF LITTLE BOY BLUE   But it was not your niece  It was always you I wanted   said the Boy   He lay back  in a deep wicker chair  under the old mulberry tree  He had taken the precaution of depositing his cup and saucer on the soft turf beneath his chair  because he knew that  under the stress of sudden emotion  china especially the best china had a way of flying off his knee  And there was no question as to the exquisite quality of the china on the dainty tea table over which Miss Christobel Charteris presided   The Boy had watched her pouring the tea into those pretty rose leaf cups  nearly every afternoon during the golden two weeks just over  He knew every movement of those firm white hands  so soft  yet so strong and capable   The Boy used to stand beside her  ready to hand Mollie s cup  as punctiliously as if a dozen girls had been sitting in the old garden  waiting to be quickly served by the only man   The Boy enjoyed being the only man  Also he had quite charming manners  He never allowed the passing of bread and butter to interfere with the flow of conversation  yet the bread and butter was always within reach at the precise moment you wanted it  though the Boy s bright eyes were fixed just then in keenest interest on the person who happened to be speaking  and not a point of the story  or a word of the remark  was missed either by him or by you   He used to watch the Aunt s beautiful hands very closely  and at last  every time he looked at them  his brown eyes kissed them  The Boy thought this was a delightful secret known only to himself  But one day  when he was bending over her  holding his own cup while she filled it  the Aunt suddenly said   Don t    It was so startling and unexpected  that the cup almost flew out of his hand  The Boy might have said   Don t  what   which would have put the Aunt in a difficulty  because it would have been so very impossible to explain  But he was too honest  He at once didn t   and felt a little shy for five minutes  then recovered  and hugged himself with a fearful joy at the thought that she had known his eyes had kissed her dear beautiful hands  then stole a look at her calm face  so completely unmoved in its classic beauty  and thought he must have been mistaken  only what on earth else could she have said  Don t    about  at that moment   But Mollie was there  then  so no explanations were possible  Now at last  thank goodness  Mollie had gone  and his own seven days had begun  This was the first day  and he was going to tell her everything  There was absolutely nothing he would not be able to tell her  The delight of this fairly swept the Boy off his feet  He had kept on the curb so long  and he was not used to curbs of any kind   He lay back  his hands behind his head  and watched the Aunt s kind face  through half closed lids  His brown eyes were shining  but very soft  When the Aunt looked at them  she quickly looked away    How could you think the attraction would be gone   he said   It was always you  I wanted  not your niece  Good heavens  How can you have thought it was Mollie  when it was you YOU  just only you  all the time    The Aunt raised her beautiful eyebrows and looked him straight in the face    Is this a proposal   she asked  quietly    Of course it is   said the Boy   and jolly hard it has been  having to wait two whole weeks to make it  I want you to marry me  Christobel  I dare say you think me a cheeky young beggar to suggest it  point blank  But I want you to give me seven days  and  in those seven days  I am going to win you  Then it will seem to you  as it does to me  the only possible thing to do    His brown eyes were wide open now  and the glory of the love shining out from them dazzled her  She looked away   Then the swift colour swept over the face which all Cambridge considered classic in its stern strong beauty  and she laughed  but rather breathlessly    You amazing boy   she said   Do you consider it right to take away a person s breath  in this fashion  Or are you trying to be funny     I have no designs on your breath   said the Boy   and it is my misfortune  but not my fault  if I seem funny   Then he sat forward in his chair  his elbows on his knees  and both brown hands held out towards her   I want you to understand  dear   he continued  earnestly   that I have said only a very little of all I have to say  But I hope that little is to the point  and I jolly well mean it    The Aunt laughed again  and swung the toe of her neat brown shoe  a habit she had  when trying to appear more at ease than she felt    It is certainly to the point   she said   There can be no possible doubt about that  But are you aware  dear boy  that I have been assiduously chaperoning you and my niece  during the past two weeks  and watching  with the affectionate interest of a middle aged relative  the course of true love running with satisfactory and unusual smoothness    The Boy ignored the adjectives and innuendoes  and went straight to the point  He always had a way of ignoring all side issues or carefully introduced irrelevancy  It made him a difficult person to deal with  if the principal weapon in your armoury was elaborate argument    Why did you say  Don t     asked the Boy   The Aunt fell at once into the unintentional trap  She dropped her calmly amused manner and answered hurriedly  while again the swift colour flooded her face   Boy dear  I hardly know  It was something you did  which  for a moment  I could not quite bear  Something passed from you to me  too intimate  too sweet  to be quite right  I said  Don t    as involuntarily as one would say  Don t   to a threatened blow     It wasn t  a blow   said the Boy  tenderly   It was a kiss  Every time I looked at your dear beautiful hand  lifting the silver teapot  I kissed it  Didn t  you feel it was a kiss     No  I only felt it was unusual  something I could not understand  and I did not like it  Therefore I said  Don t       But you admit it was sweet   persisted the Boy    Exactly   replied the Aunt   quite incomprehensibly sweet  And I do not like things I cannot comprehend  especially with amazing boys about     Didn t  you know it was love   asked the Boy  softly    No   replied the Aunt  emphatically   most certainly  I did not    The Boy got up  and came and knelt beside the arm of her chair    It was love   he said  his lips very close to the soft waves of her hair    Go back to your seat at once   said the Aunt  sternly   The Boy went    And where does poor Mollie come in  in all this   inquired the Aunt  with some asperity    Mollie   said the Boy  complacently   Oh  Mollie understood all right  She loves Phil  you know  intends to stick to him  and knows you will back her  The last part of the time  I brought her notes from Phil  every day  Don t  be angry  dear  You would have done it yourself  if Mollie and Phil had got hold of you  and implored you to be a go between  You remember the day we invaded the kitchen to see how Martha made those little puffy buns you know the explosives  You pinch them in the middle  and they burst into hundreds and thousands of little pieces  Jolly things for a stiff stand up in a crowd and all hold your own cups kind of drawing room party  what we used to call  a Perpendicular  in my Cambridge days  I suppose they still keep up the name  Fancy those little buns exploding all over the place  and when you try to pick up the fragments  they go into simply millions of crumbs  between your agitated fingers and anxious thumb    The Boy slapped his knee in intense enjoyment  and momentarily lost the thread of the conversation  The Aunt s mind was not sufficiently detached to feel equal to a digression into peals of laughter over this vision of the explosive buns  She wanted to find out how much Mollie knew  When the Boy had finished rocking backwards and forwards in his chair  she suggested  tentatively   You went to the kitchen      Oh  yes   said the Boy  recovering   We went to the kitchen to watch Martha make them  and to get the recipe  You see Mollie wanted them for her father s clerical  at homes   Oh  I say fancy  The archdeacons and curates  the rectors and vicars  all standing in a solemn crowd on the Bishop s best velvet pile carpet  then Mollie  so demure  handing round the innocent looking little buns  and  hey presto  the pinching begins  and the explosions  and the hopeless attempts to gather up the fragments    The Boy nearly went off again  but he suddenly realized that the Aunt was not amused  and pulled himself together    Well  we stopped on the way to the kitchen for mutual confidences  It was not easy  bounded as we were by you on the one side  and Martha on the other  We had to whisper  I dare say you thought we were kissing behind the door  but we jolly well weren t   She told me about Phil  and I told her oh  I told her something of what I am trying to tell you  Just enough to make her understand  so that we could go ahead  and play the game fair  all round  She was awfully glad  because she said   I have long feared my dear beautiful Aunt would marry an ichthyosaurus   I asked her what the what the I mean  what on earth the meaning of that was  And she said   An old fossil     Again the swift flush swept over the calm face  But this time the Aunt went off  intentionally  on a side issue    I have heard you say  What the deuce  before now  Boy  But I am glad you appear to realize  judging by your laboured efforts to suppress them  that these expressions shock me    She looked at him  quizzically  through half closed lids  but the Boy was wholly earnest    Well  you see   he said   I am trying most awfully hard to be  in every respect  just what you would wish the man who loves you should be     Oh  you dear boy   said Christobel Charteris  a flood of sudden feeling softening her face   I must make you understand that I cannot possibly take you seriously  I shall have to tell you a story no one has ever heard before  a tender little story of a long ago past  I must tell you the story of my Little Boy Blue  Wait here a few moments  while I go indoors and give orders that we are not to be disturbed    Rising  she passed up the lawn to the little white house  The Boy s eyes followed her  noting with pride and delight the tall athletic figure  fully developed  gracious in its ample lines  yet graceful in the perfect swing of the well poised walk  During all his college years he had known that walk  admired that stately figure  He had been in the set which called her  Juno  and  The Goddess   which crowded to the clubs if there was a chance of watching her play tennis  And now  during two wonderful weeks  he had been admitted  a welcomed guest  to this little old world oasis  bounded by high red brick walls  where she dwelt and ruled  Quiet  sunny  happy hours he had spent in the hush of the old garden  strolling up and down the long narrow velvet turf  beneath the spreading trees  from the green postern gate in the right hand corner of the bottom wall  to the flight of stone steps leading up to the garden door of the little white house   The Boy knew  by now  exactly what he wanted  He wanted to marry Christobel Charteris   He must have been rather a brave boy  He looked very youthful and slim as he lay back in his chair  watching the stately proportions of the woman on whom he had set his young heart  very slight and boyish  in his silver grey suit  with lavender tie  and buttonhole of violas  The Boy was very particular about his ties and buttonholes  They always matched  This afternoon  for the first time  he had arrived without a buttonhole  In the surprise and pleasure of his unexpected appearance  the Aunt had moved quickly down the sunlit lawn to meet and greet him   Mollie had departed  early that morning  Her final words at the railway station  as her impish little face smiled farewell from the window of her compartment  had been   Mind  Auntie dear  no mistake about Guy Chelsea  He s a charming fellow  and thank you ever so much for giving me such a good time with him  But you can report to Papa  that Guy Chelsea  and his beautiful properties  and his prospective peerage  and his fifty thousand a year  and his motor cars  and his flying machines  are absolutely powerless to tempt me away from my allegiance to Phil  Beside  it so happens  Guy himself is altogether in love with SOME ONE ELSE    The train having begun to move at the words  You can report to Papa   Mollie finished the remainder of the sentence in a screaming crescendo  holding on to her hat with one hand  and waving a tiny lace pocket handkerchief  emphatically  with the other  Even then  the Aunt lost most of the sentence  and disbelieved the rest  The atmosphere of love had been so unmistakable during those two weeks  the superabundant overflow had even reached herself more than once  with an almost startling thrill of emotion   The Boy had been so full of vivid  glowing joie de vivre  radiating fun and gaiety around him   In their sets of tennis  played on her own court across the lane at the bottom of the garden  when she could beat him easily were he handicapped by partnership with Mollie  but in genuine singles  when Mollie had tactfully collapsed on to a seat and declared herself exhausted  his swift agility counterbalanced her magnificent service  and they were so evenly matched that each game proved a keen delight   In the quiet teas beneath the mulberry tree  where the incomprehensible atmosphere of unspoken tenderness gilded the light words and laughter  as sunlight touches leaf and flower to gold   At the cosy dinners  to which they sometimes asked him  sitting in the garden afterwards in the moonlight  when he would tell them thrilling tales of aviation  describing his initial flights  hairbreadth escapes  the joys of rapid soaring  the dangers of cross currents  broken propellers  or twisted steering gear   On all these occasions  the Boy with his enthusiasm  his fun  and his fire had been the life of the happy trio   During those evenings  in the moonlight  when he started off on airships  one heart stood still very often while the Boy talked  but it stood still  silently  It was Mollie who clasped her hands and implored him never to fly again  then  in the next breath  begged him to take her as a passenger  on the first possible occasion   Happy days  But Mollie was the attraction  therefore  with Mollie s departure  they would naturally come to an end   The Boy had not asked if he might come again  and  for the moment  she forgot that the Boy rarely asked for what he wanted  He usually took it   She had a lonely luncheon  spent the afternoon over letters and accounts  picking up the dull threads of things laid aside during the gay holiday time   It was not the Professor s day for calling  She was alone until four  Then she went out and sat under the mulberry  The garden was very quiet  The birds  hour of silence was barely over   Jenkins  the butler  had been sent into the town  so Martha brought out tea  as ample  as carefully arranged  as ever  and cups for two    Why two cups  Martha   queried Miss Charteris  languidly    Maybe there ll be a visitor   said Martha in grim prophetic tones  Then her hard old face relaxed and creased into an unaccustomed smile   Maybe there is a visitor   she added  softly  for at that moment the postern gate banged  and they saw the Boy coming up the garden  in a shaft of sunlight   The Aunt walked quickly to meet him  His arrival was so unexpected  and she had been so lonely  and so dull    How nice of you   she said   with the Attraction gone  But Martha seems to have had a premonition of your coming  She has just brought out tea  most suggestively arranged for two  How festive you are  Boy  Why this wedding attire  Are you coming from  or going to  a function  No  Then don t  you want tennis after tea a few good hard sets  just we two  unhandicapped by our dear little Mollie     No   said the Boy   talk  please  to day  just we two  unhandicapped by our dear little Mollie  Talk please  not tennis    He paused beside the border  full of mauve and purple flowers   How jolly those little what d  you call  ems look  in the sunshine   he said   Then the Aunt noticed that he wore no buttonhole  and that his tie was lavender  She picked four of her little violas  and pinned them into his coat    Boy dear   she said   you are a dandy in the matter of ties and buttonholes  only it is so essentially you  that one rather enjoys it  But this is the first day I have known you to arrive without one  and have need to fall back upon my garden     It is a first day   said the Boy  dropping into step with her  as she moved toward the mulberry tree   It starts a new r gime  in the matter of buttonholes  and other things  I am going to have seven days  and this is the first     Really   smiled the Aunt  amused at the Boy s intense seriousness   I am flattered that you should spend a portion of  the first day  with me  Let us have tea  and then you shall tell me why seven days  and where you mean to pass them    The Boy was rather silent during tea  The Aunt  trying to read his mind  thought at first that he regretted his flannels  and the chance of tennis  then that he was missing Mollie  Whereupon the Aunt repeated her remark that it was nice of him to come  now the Attraction was no longer there   This gave him the cue for which he waited  His cup was empty  and safely on the grass  The floodgates of the Boy s pent up love and longing burst open  the unforgettable words   It was always you I wanted   were spoken  and now he waited for her  under the mulberry tree  She had something to tell him  but  whatever it might be  it could not seriously affect the situation  He had told her that was the great essential  He would win her in seven days  Already she knew just what he wanted a big step for the first day  He looked up  and saw her coming   She had regained her usual calm  Her eyes were very kind  She smiled at the Boy  gently   She took her seat in a low basket work chair  He had leapt to his feet  She motioned him to another  just opposite hers  She was feeling rather queenly  Unconsciously her manner became somewhat regal  The Boy enjoyed it  He knew he was bent upon winning a queen among women    I am going to tell you a story   she said    Yes   said the Boy    It is about my Little Boy Blue     Yes     You were my Little Boy Blue     I     Yes  twenty years ago     Then I was six   said the Boy  quite unperturbed    We were staying at Dovercourt  on the east coast  Our respective families had known each other  I used to watch you playing on the shore  You were a very tiny little boy     I dare say I was quite a nice little boy   said the Boy  complacently    Indeed you were  quite sweet  You wore white flannel knickers  and a little blue coat     I dare say it was quite a nice little coat   said the Boy   and I hope my womenfolk had the tact to call it a  blazer      It was a dear little coat I should say  blazer    said the Aunt   and I called you my  Little Boy Blue   You also had a blue flannel cap  which you wore stuck on the back of your curls  I spoke to you twice  Little Boy Blue     Did you   he said  and his brown eyes were tender   Then no wonder I feel I have loved you all my life     Ah  but wait until you hear my story  The first time I spoke to you  it happened thus  Your nurse sat high up on the beach  in the long line of nurses  gossiping and doing needlework  You took your little spade and bucket  and marched away  all by yourself  to a breakwater  and there you built a splendid sand castle  I sat on the breakwater  higher up  and watched you  You took immense pains  you overcame stupendous difficulties  and every time your little cap fell off  you picked it up  dusted off the sand with the sleeve of your little blue coat  and stuck it on the back of your curly head again  You were very sweet  Little Boy Blue  I can see you now    The Aunt paused  and let her eyes dwell upon the Boy in appreciative retrospection  If he felt this something of an ordeal  he certainly showed no signs of it  Not for a moment did his face lose its expression of delighted interest    Presently   continued the Aunt   your castle and courtyard finished  you made a little cannon in the centre of the courtyard  for defence  Then you looked around for a cannon ball  This was evidently a weighty matter  and indeed it turned out to be such  You stood your spade against the breakwater  placed your bucket beside it  readjusted your little cap  and trotted off almost to the water s edge  Your conception of the size of your castle and cannon must have become magnified with every step of those small sturdy feet  for  arrived at the water  you found a huge round stone nearly as large as your own little head  This satisfied you completely  but you soon found you could not carry it in your hands  You spent a moment in anxious consideration  Then you took off your little blue coat  spread it upon the sand  rolled the cannon ball upon it  tied the sleeves around it  picked up the hem and the collar  hoisted the heavy stone  and proceeded slowly and with difficulty up the shore  Every moment it seemed as if the stone must fall  and crush the bare toes of my Little Boy Blue  So I flew to the rescue     Little Boy Blue   I said   may I help you to carry your stone     You paused  and looked up at me  I doubt if you had breath to answer while you were walking  Your little face was flushed and damp with exertion  the blue cap was almost off  you had sand on your eyebrows  and sand on your little straight nose  But you looked at me with an expression of indomitable courage and pride  and you said   Fanks  but I always does my own cawwying   With that you started on  and I fell behind rebuffed     Surly little beast   ejaculated the Boy    Not at all   said the Aunt   I won t  have my Little Boy Blue called names  He showed a fine independence of spirit  Now hear what happened next    Little Boy Blue had almost reached his castle  with his somewhat large  but otherwise suitable  cannon ball  when his nurse  glancing up from her needlework  perceived him staggering along in his shirt sleeves  and also saw the use to which he was putting his flannel coat  She threw aside the blue over all she was making  rushed down the shore  calling my Little Boy Blue every uncomplimentary compound noun and adjective which entered her irate and flurried mind  seized the precious stone  unwound the little jacket  flung the stone away  shook out the sand and seaweed  and straightened the twisted sleeves  Then she proceeded to shake the breath out of my Little Boy Blue s already rather breathless little body  put on the coat  jerked him up the shore  and plumped him down with his back to the sea and his castle  to sit in disgrace and listen  while she told the assembled nurses what a  born himp of hevil  he was  I could have slain that woman  And I knew my little Boy Blue had no dear mother of his own  I wanted to take him in my arms  smooth his tumbled curls  and comfort him  And all this time he had not uttered a sound  He had just explained to me that he always did his own carrying  and evidently he had learned to bear his childish sorrows in silence  I watched the little disconsolate blue back  usually so gaily erect  now round with shame and woe  Then I bethought me of something I could do  I made quite sure he was not peeping round  Then I went and found the chosen stone  and it was heavy indeed  I carried it to the breakwater  and deposited it carefully within the courtyard of the castle  Then I sat down behind the breakwater  on the other side  and waited  I felt sure Little Boy Blue would come back for his spade and bucket    Presently the nurses grew tired of bullying him  The strength of his quiet non resistance proved greater than their superior numbers and brute force  Also his intelligent little presence was  undoubtedly  a check upon their gossip  So he was told he might go  I conclude  on the understanding that he should  be a good boy  and carry no more  nasty heavy stones   I saw him rise and shake the dust of the nurses  circle off his little feet  Then he pushed back his curls  and  without looking to the right or to the left  trotted straight to his castle  I wondered he did not glance  however hopelessly  in the supposed direction of the desired stone  But  no  He came gaily on  and the light of a great expectation shone in his brown eyes    When he reached the breakwater  and found his castle  there safely in the courtyard reposed the mighty cannon ball  He stood still a moment  looking at it  and his cheeks went very pink  Then he pulled off his little cap  and turned his radiant face up to the blue sky  flecked with fleeting white clouds  And  Fank de Lord   said my Little Boy Blue    There were unconcealed tears in the Aunt s kind eyes  and she controlled her quiet voice with difficulty  But the glory of a great gladness had come over the Boy  Without as yet explaining itself in words  it rang in his voice and laughter    I remember   he said   Why  of course I remember  Not you  worse luck  but being lugged up the shore  and fearing I had lost my cannon ball  And  you know  as quite a tiny chap  I had formed a habit of praying about all my little wants and woes  I sometimes think  how amused the angels must have been when my small petitions arrived  There was a scarecrow  in a field  I prayed for  regularly  every night  for weeks  I had been struck by the fact that it looked lonely  Then I seriously upset the theology of the nursery  by passing through a course of persistent and fervent prayer for Satan  It appeared as an obvious logical conclusion to my infant mind  that if the person who according to nurse spent all his time in going about making everybody naughty  could himself become good  all naughtiness would cease  Also  that anybody must be considered as  past praying for   was an idea which nearly broke my small heart With rage and misery  when it was first crudely forced upon me  I think the arch fiend must have turned away  silent and nonplussed  if he ever chanced to pass by  while a very tiny boy was kneeling up in his crib  pleading with tearful earnestness   Please God  bless poor old Satan  make him good an  happy  an  take him back to heaven   But it used to annoy nurse considerably  when she came into the same prayer  with barely a comma between     Oh  my Little Boy Blue   cried the Aunt   Why was I not your mother     Thank goodness  you were not   said the Boy  imperturbably   I don t  want you for a mother  dear  I want you for my wife     So you had prayed about the stone   remarked the Aunt  hurriedly    Yes  While seated there in disgrace  I said   Please God  let an angel find my cannon ball  which howwid old nurse fwowed away  An  let the angel cawwy it safe to the courtyard of my castle   And I was not at all surprised to find it there  merely very glad  So you see  Christobel  you were my guardian angel twenty years ago  No wonder I feel I have known and loved you  all my life     Wait until you hear the rest of my story  Little Boy Blue  But I can testify that you were not surprised  Your brown eyes were simply shining with faith and expectation  as you trotted down the shore  But who said you might call me  Christobel      No one   replied the Boy   I thought of it myself  It seemed so perfect to be able to say it on the first of my seven days  And  if you consider  I have never called you  Miss Charteris   You always seemed to me much too splendid to be  Miss  anything  One might as well say  Miss Joan of Arc  or  Miss Diana of the Ephesians   But of course I won t  call you  Christobel  if you would rather not     You quite absurd boy   said the Aunt  laughing   Call me anything you like just for your seven days  But you have not yet told me the meaning or significance of these seven days    The Boy sat forward  eagerly    It s like this   he said   I have always loved the story of how the army of Israel marched round Jericho during seven days  It appeals to me  The well garrisoned  invincible city  with its high walls and barred gates  The silent  determined army  marching round it  once every day  Apparently nothing was happening  but  in reality  their faith  enthusiasm  and will power were undermining those mighty walls  And on the seventh day  when they marched round seven times to the blast of the priestly trumpets  at the seventh time  the ordeal of silence was over  leave was given to the great silent host to shout  So the rams  horns sounded a louder blast than ever  and then  with all the pent up enthusiasm born of those seven days of silent marching  the people shouted  Down fell the walls of Jericho  and up the conquerors went  right into the heart of the citadel     I am prepared to march round in silence  during seven days  but on the seventh day  Jericho will be taken     I being Jericho  I conclude   remarked the Aunt  dryly   I cannot say I have particularly noticed the silence  But that part of the programme would be decidedly dull  so we will omit it  and say  from the first   little Boy Blue  come blow me your horn      I shall blow it all right  on the seventh day   said the Boy   and when I do  you will hear it    He got up  came across  and knelt by the arm of her chair    I shall walk right up into the heart of the citadel   he said   when the gates fly open  and the walls fall down  and there I shall find you  my Queen  and together we shall  inherit the kingdom   O dear unconquered Citadel  O beautiful  golden kingdom  Don t  you wish it was the seventh day now  Christobel    His mouth looked so sweet  as he bent over her and said  Christobel   with a queer little accent on the final syllable  that the Aunt felt momentarily dizzy    Go back to your chair  at once  Boy   she whispered   And he went   Neither spoke a word  for some minutes  The Boy lay back  watching the mysterious moving of the mulberry leaves  The triumphant happiness in his face was a rather breathless thing to see  It made you want to hear a great orchestra burst into the Hallelujah Chorus   The Aunt watched the Boy  and wondered whether she must tell him about the Professor  before the seventh day  and what he would say  when she did tell him  and how Jericho would feel when the army of Israel  with silent trumpets and banners drooping  marched disconsolate away  leaving its walls still standing  its gates still barred  Poor walls  supposed to be so mighty  Already they were trembling  If the Boy had not been so chivalrously obedient  he could have broken into the citadel  five minutes ago  Did he know       She looked at his radiant face     Yes  he knew  There were not many things the Boy did not know  She must not allow the seven days  even though she could absolutely trust his obedience and his chivalry  She must tell him the rest of the story  and send him away to day  Poor invading army  shorn of its glad triumph  Poor Jericho  left desolate  It was decidedly unusual to be compared to Jericho  and Diana of the Ephesians  and Joan of Arc  all in the same conversation  and it was rather funny to enjoy it  But then most things which happened by reason of the Boy were funny and unusual  He would always come marching  as an army with banners   The Professor would drive up to Jericho in a fly  and knock a decorous rat tat on the gate  Would the walls tremble at that knock  Alas  alas  They had never trembled yet  Would they ever tremble again  save for the march past of the Boy  Would the gates ever really fly open  except to the horn blast of little Boy Blue      The Aunt dared not think any longer  She felt she must take refuge in immediate action    Boy dear   she said  in her most maternal voice   come down from the clouds  and listen to me  I want to tell you the rest of the story of my Little Boy Blue    He sprang up  and came and sat on the grass at her feet  All the Boy s movements were so bewilderingly sudden  They were over and done  before you had time to consider whether or no you intended to allow them  But this new move was quite satisfactory  He looked less big and manly  down on the grass  and she really felt maternal  with his curly head so close to her knee  She even ventured to put out a cool motherly hand and smooth the hair back from his forehead  as she began to speak  She had intended to touch it only once just to accentuate the fact of her motherliness but it was the sort of soft thick hair which seemed meant for the gentle passing through it of a woman s fingers  And the Boy seemed to like it  for he gave one long sigh of content  and leaned his head against her knee    Now I must tell you   said the Aunt   of the only other time when I ventured to speak to my Little Boy Blue  He had come to his favourite place beside the breakwater  The tide had long ago swept away castle  courtyard  and cannon  but the cannon ball was still there  It partook of the nature of  things that remain   Heavy stones usually do  When I peeped over the breakwater  Little Boy Blue was sitting on the sand  His sturdy legs were spread wide  His bare toes looked like ten little pink sea shells  Between his small brown knees  he had planted his bucket  His right hand wielded a wooden spade  on the handle of which was writ large  in blue pencil  Master Guy Chelsea  He was bent upon filling his bucket with sand  But the spade being long  and the bucket too close to him  Boy  leave my shoe alone  It does not require attention  most of the sand missed the bucket  and went over himself  I heard him sigh rather wearily  and say  Blow   in a tired little voice  I leaned over the breakwater   Little Boy Blue   I said   may I play with you  and help you to fill your bucket with sand     Little Boy Blue looked up  His curls  his eyebrows  his long dark eyelashes were full of sand  There was sand on his little straight nose  But no amount of sand could detract from the dignity of his little face  or weaken its stern decision  He laid down his spade  put up a damp little hand  and  lifting his blue cap to me  said   Fanks  but I don t  like girls   Oh  Master Guy Chelsea  how you snubbed me    The Boy s broad shoulders shook with laughter  but he captured the hand still smoothing his hair  and  drawing it down to his lips  kissed it gently  back and palm  and then each finger    Poor kind hearted  well meaning little girl   he said   But she must admit  little girls of seven are not always attractive to small boys of six     I was not seven   said the Aunt  with portentous emphasis   Leave go of my hand  Boy  and listen  When you were six  I was sixteen    This bomb of the Aunt s was received with a moment s respectful silence  as befitted the discharge of her principal field piece  Then the Boy s gay voice said    And what of that  dear  When I was six  you were sixteen  When I was twenty  you were twenty nine     Thirty  Boy  thirty  Be accurate  And now you are twenty six  and I am getting on towards forty     Thirty six  dear  thirty six  Be accurate   pleaded the Boy    And when you are forty  I shall be fifty  and when you are fifty  Boy only fifty  a man is in his prime at fifty I shall be sixty     And when I am eighty   said the Boy   you will be ninety an old lady is in her prime at ninety  What a charming old couple we shall be  I wonder if we shall still play tennis  I think quite the jolliest thing to do  when we are very very old quite decrepit  you know will be to stay at Folkestone  and hire two bath chairs  with nice active old men to draw them  ancient  of course  but they would seem young compared to us  and then make them race on the Leas  a five pound note to the winner  to insure them really galloping  We would start at the most crowded time  when the band was playing  and race in and out among lots of other bath chairs going slowly  and simply terrified at us  Let s be sure and remember to do it  Christobel  sixty years from to day  Have you a pocket book  I shall be a gay young person of eighty six  and you     Boy dear   she said  bending over him  with a catch in her voice   you must be serious and listen  When I have said that which I must say  you will understand directly that it is no use having your seven days  It will be better and wiser to raise the siege at once  and march away  Listen      Hush  stay perfectly still  No  I can say what I am going to say more easily if you don t  look at me     Please  Boy  please     I told you my  Little Boy Blue stories  to make you realize how very much older I am than you  I was practically grown up  when you were still a dear delightful baby  I could have picked you up in my arms and carried you about  Oh  cannot you see that  however much I loved him perhaps I should rather say  just because I love him  because I have always wanted to help him carry his heavy stones  make the best of his life  and accomplish manfully the tasks he sets himself to do I could not possibly marry my Little Boy Blue  I could not  oh I could not  let him tie his youth and brightness to a woman  staid and middle aged  who might almost be his mother    The earnest  anxious voice  eager in its determined insistence  ceased   The Boy sat very still  his head bent forward  his brown hands clasping his knees  Then suddenly he knelt up beside her  leaned over the arm of her chair  and looked into her eyes  There was in his face such a tender reverence of adoration  that the Aunt knew she need not be afraid to have him so near  This was holy ground  She put from off her feet the shoes of doubt and distrust  waiting  in perfect calmness  to hear what he had to say    Dear   murmured the Boy  tenderly   your little stories might possibly have had the effect you intended specially the place where you paused and gazed at me as if you saw me still with sand upon my nose  and ten pink toes like sea shells  That was calculated to make any chap feel youngish  and a bit shy  Wasn t  it  Yes  they might have told the way you meant  were it not for one dear sentence which overshadows all the rest  You said just now   I knew my little Boy Blue had no mother  I wanted to take him in my arms  smooth his curls  and comfort him   Christobel  that dear wish of yours was a gift you then gave to your Little Boy Blue  You can t  take it away now  because he has grown bigger  He still has no mother  no sisters  no near relations in the world  That all holds good  Can you refuse him the haven  the help  the comfort you would have given him then  now when at last he is old enough to know and understand  to turn to them  in grateful worship and wonder  Would you have me marry a girl as feather brained  as harum scarum  as silly as I often am myself  You suggest Mollie  but the Boy Blue of to day agrees with his small wise self of twenty years ago and says   Fanks  but I don t  like girls   Oh  Christobel  I want a woman s love  a woman s arms  a woman s understanding tenderness  You said  just now  you wished you had been my mother  Does not the love of the sort of wife a fellow really wants  have a lot of the mother in it too  I ve  been filled with such a glory  Christobel  since you admitted what you felt for your Little Boy Blue because I seemed to know  somehow  that having once felt it  though the feeling may have gone to sleep  you could never put it quite away  But  if your Little Boy Blue came back  from the other end of the world  and wanted you    The Boy stopped suddenly  struck dumb by the look on the beautiful face beneath his  He saw it pale to absolute whiteness  while the dear firm lips faltered and trembled  He saw the startled pain leap into the eyes  He did not understand the cause of her emotion  or know that he had wakened in that strongly repressed nature the desperate hunger for motherhood  possible only to woman at the finest and best   She realized now why she had never forgotten her Little Boy Blue of the Dovercourt sands  He  in his baby beauty and sweetness  had wakened the embryo mother in the warm hearted girl of sixteen  And now he had come back  in the full strength of his young manhood  overflowing with passionate ideality and romance  to teach the lonely woman of thirty six the true sweet meaning of love and of wifehood   Her heart seemed to turn to marble and cease beating  She felt helpless in her pain  Only the touch of her Little Boy Blue  or of baby Boy Blues so like him  that they must have come trotting down the sands of life straight from the heaven of his love and hers  could ever still this ache at her bosom   She looked helplessly up into his longing  glowing  boyish face so sweet  so young  so beautiful   Should she put up her arms and draw it to her breast   She had given no actual promise to the Professor  She had not mentioned him to the Boy   Ah  dear God  If one had waited twelve long years for a thing which was to prove but an empty husk after all  In order not to fail the possible expectations of another  had she any right to lay such a heavy burden of disappointment upon her little Boy Blue  And  if she must do so  how could she best help him to bear it    Fanks   came a brave little voice  with almost startling distinctness  across the shore of memory   Fanks  but I always does my own cawwying    At last she found her voice    Boy dear   she said  gently   please go now  I am tired    Then she shut her eyes   In a few seconds she heard the gate close  and knew the garden was empty   Tears slipped from between the closed lids  and coursed slowly down her cheeks  The only right way is apt to be a way of such pain at the moment  that even those souls possessing clearest vision and endowed with strongest faith  are unable to hear the golden clarion call  sounding amid the din of present conflict   Through much tribulation  enter into the kingdom    Thus hopeless tears fell in the old garden   And Martha  the elderly housekeeper  faithful but curious  let fall the lath of the green Venetian blind covering the storeroom window  through which she had permitted herself to peep  As the postern gate closed on the erect figure of the Boy  she dropped the blind and turned away  an unwonted tear running down the furrows of her hard old face    Lord love  im   she said   He ll get what he wants in time  There s not a woman walks this earth as couldn t  never refuse  im nothing    With which startling array of negatives  old Martha compiled one supreme positive in favour of the Boy  leaving altogether out of account alas  the Professor   Then she wiped her eyes with her apron  and chid her nose harshly for an unexpected display of sentiment   And the Boy tramped back to his hotel with his soul full of glory  knowing his first march round had been to some purpose  The walls of the beloved Citadel had trembled indeed    And the evening and the morning were the first day       THE SECOND DAY  MISS CHARTERIS TAKES CONTROL  The Boy arrived in flannels  his racket under his arm  He came in  as usual  through the little green gate in the red brick fruit wall at the bottom of the garden  From the first  he had taken this privilege  which as a matter of fact had never been accorded to anybody   The Professor always entered by the front door  placed his umbrella in the stand  wet or shine  left his goloshes on the mat  hung up his cap and gown  and followed Jenkins into the drawing room  Though he had called regularly  twice a week  during the last dozen years first on his old friend and tutor  Professor Charteris  after his death  on his widow and daughter  and  when Miss Charteris was left alone  on herself only he never failed to knock and ring  nor did he ever enter unannounced   The Boy had dashed in at the garden gate on the occasion of his second visit  and appeared to consider that he had thus created a precedent which should always be followed   Once  and once only on her thirtieth birthday the Professor had brought Miss Charteris a bouquet  but  being very absent minded  he deposited the bouquet on the mat  and advanced into the drawing room carrying his goloshes in his left hand  Having shaken hands with his right  he vaguely presented the goloshes  Miss Charteris  never at a loss where her friends were concerned  took the Professor s goloshes from his hand  carried them out into the hall  found the bouquet on the mat  and saved the situation by putting the flowers in water  and thanking the Professor with somewhat more hilarity than the ordinary presentation of a bouquet would have called forth   But to return to the second day  The Boy arrived in flannels  and tea was a merry meal  The Boy wanted particulars concerning the marriage  which had taken place a year or so before  between Martha maid of thirty years  standing  now acting as cook housekeeper to Miss Charteris and Jenkins  the butler  The Boy wanted to know which proposed  Jenkins or Martha  in what terms they announced the fact of their engagement  to Miss Charteris  whether Jenkins ever  bucked up and looked like a bridegroom   and whether Martha wore orange blossom and a wedding veil  He extorted the admission that Christobel had been present at the wedding  and insisted on a detailed account  over which  when given at last  he slapped his knee so often  and went into such peals of laughter  that Miss Charteris glanced anxiously towards the kitchen and pantry windows  which unfortunately looked out on the garden   The Boy expatiated on his enthusiastic admiration for Martha  but at the same time was jolly well certain he would have bolted when it came to  I  Martha  take thee  Jenkins   had he stood in the latter s shoes  Miss Charteris did not dare admit  that as a matter of fact the sentence had been   I  Martha  take thee  Noah   That the meek Jenkins should possess so historical and patriarchal a name  would completely have finished the Boy  who was already taking considerable risks by combining much laughter with an unusually large number of explosive buns   The Boy would have it  that  excepting in the r le of bride and subsequent conjugal owner and disciplinarian  Martha was perfect   Miss Charteris admitted Martha s unrivalled excellence as a cook  her economy in management  and fidelity of heart  But Martha had a temper  Also  though undoubtedly a superficial fault  yet trying to the artistic eye of Miss Charteris  Martha s hair was apt to be dishevelled and untidy    It is a bit wispy   admitted the Boy  reluctantly   Why don t  you tell her so    Miss Charteris smiled   Boy dear  I daren t   It would be as much as my place is worth  to make a personal observation to Martha     I ll tell her for you  if you like   said the Boy  coolly    If you do   warned Miss Charteris   it will be the very last remark you will ever make in Martha s kitchen  Boy     Oh  there are ways of telling   said the Boy  airily  and pinched an explosive bun   After tea they took their rackets and strolled down the lawn  pausing a moment while she chose him a buttonhole  The tie was orange on this second day  and she gathered the opening bud of a William Allen Richardson rose  She smiled into its golden heart as she pinned it in his white flannel coat  Somehow it brought a flash of remembrance of the golden heart of Little Boy Blue  who could not bear that any one should be past praying for  or that even a scarecrow should seem lonely   They crossed the lane and entered the paddock  tightened the net on the tennis court  chose out half a dozen brand new balls  and settled down to fast and furious singles   Miss Charteris played as well as she had ever played in her life  but the Boy was off his service  and she beat him six to four  Next time  he pulled off  games all   but lost the set  then was beaten  three to six   Miss Charteris was glowing with the exercise  and the consciousness of being in great form    Boy dear   she called  as she played the winning stroke of the third set   I m afraid you re lazy to day    The Boy walked up to the net  and looked at her through his racket    I m not lazy   he said   but I m on the wrong side of Jordan  This sort of thing is waste of time  I want to go over  and start marching     Don t  be absurd  Boy  I prefer this side Jordan  thank you  and you shall stay here until you beat me    The Boy won the next set   It was deliciously cool and quiet under the mulberry tree   The Boy was quite subdued for him  He seemed inclined to do his marching in silence  on this second day   Miss Charteris felt her mental balance restored  She held the reins to day  and began considering how to deal wisely with the Boy  So much depended upon how she managed him   At length she said   Boy  when you were at Trinity  I often used to see you  I knew you were my Little Boy Blue of all those years ago  I used to feel inclined to send for you  talk to you for your good  and urge you to set to  and do great things  but I remembered the stone  and the bucket  and I did not want to let myself in for a third snubbing    The Boy smiled   Did you think me a lazy beggar   he asked   I wasn t  really  you know  I did quite a good deal of all kinds of things  But I didn t  want to get played out  I wanted to do things all the rest of my life  Fellows who grind at college and come out Senior Wranglers  begin and end there  You don t  hear of  em again     I see   said Miss Charteris  amusement in her eyes   So you felt it wisest to avoid being Senior Wrangler     Just so   said the Boy   I was content with a fairly respectable B A  and I hope you saw me take it  How rotten it is  going up in a bunch  all hanging on to an old chap s fingers     Boy  Boy  I know all about you  You wasted golden opportunities  you declined to use your excellent abilities  you gave the authorities an anxious time  You were so disgracefully popular  that everybody thought your example the finest thing to follow  and you were more or less responsible for every lark and row which took place during your time    The Boy did not smile  He looked at her  with a quaint  innocent seriousness  which made her feel almost uncomfortable    Dear   he said   I had plenty of money  and heaps of friends  and I wanted to have a good time  Also I wanted all the other fellows to have a good time  and I enjoyed getting the better of all the old fogies who had forgotten what youth was like if they d ever known it  And I had no mother to ask me questions  and no sisters to turn up at my rooms unexpectedly  But I can tell you this  Christobel  I hope to be married soon  and I hope to marry a woman so sweet and noble and pure  that her very presence tests a man s every thought  feeling  and memory  And I can honestly look into your dear eyes and say  My wife will be welcome to know every detail of every prank I ever played in Cambridge  nor is there a thing in those three years I need feel ashamed of her knowing  There  Will that do    Miss Charteris threw out a deprecatory hand   Oh  Boy dear   she said   I never doubted that  My Little Boy Blue  don t  I know you  But I cannot let you talk as if you owe me any explanations  How curious to think I saw you so often during those years  yet we never actually met    The Boy smiled   Yes   he said   we were all awfully proud of you  you know  What was it you took at Girton    Miss Charteris mentioned  modestly  the highest honours in classics as yet taken by a woman  The Boy had often heard it before  But he listened with bated breath    Yes   he said   we were awfully proud of it  because of your tennis  and because of you being well  just you  If you had been a round shouldered little person in a placket  we should have taken it differently  We always called you  The Goddess   because of your splendid walk  Did you know     No  Boy  I did not know  but I confess to feeling immensely flattered  Only  take a friend s advice  and avoid conversational allusions to plackets  because you are obviously ignorant of the meaning of the word  And now  tell me  Having successfully escaped so serious a drawback to future greatness as becoming Senior Wrangler  on what definite enterprise have you embarked     Flying   said the Boy  sitting forward in his chair   I am going to break every record  I am going to fly higher  farther  faster  than any man has ever flown before  This week  if I had not stayed on here you know originally I came up only for the  May week  I was to have done a Channel flight  Ah  you don t  know what it means  to own three flying machines  all of different make  and each the best of its kind  You feel you own the world  And then to climb into your seat and go whirling away  with the wonderful hum in your ears  mastering the air the hitherto invincible air  May I tell you what I am going to do for my next fly  Start from the high ground between Dover and Folkestone  fly over the Channel  circle round Boulogne Cathedral you remember the high dome  rising out of the old town surrounded by the ramparts  Then back across the Channel  and to ground again at Folkestone  all in one flight  and I hope to do it in record time  if winds are right     And if winds are wrong  Boy  If you rush out and take the horrid risks of the cross currents you told us about  If something happens to your propeller  and you fall headlong into the sea     Oh  it s all U P then   said the Boy  lightly   But one never expects that sort of thing to happen  and when it does  all is over so quickly that there is no time for anticipation  Beside  there must be pioneers  Every good life given  advances the cause    Christobel Charteris looked at him  His was not the terrible  unmistakable  relentless face of the bird man  He was brilliant with enthusiasm  but it was the enthusiasm of the sportsman  keen to excel  of Young England  dauntless  fearless  eager to break records  The spirit of the true bird man had not  as yet  entered into her Little Boy Blue   She pressed her hand upon her bosom  It ached still    Boy dear   she said  softly   Has it ever struck you that  if you marry  your wife whoever she might be would most probably want you to give up flying  I cannot imagine a woman being able to bear that a man who was her all  should do these things    The Boy never turned a hair  He did not bound in his seat  He did not even look at her    Why  of course  dear   he said   if you wished it  I should give up flying  like a shot  and sell my aeroplanes  I know plenty of chaps who would like to buy them to morrow  And I ll tell you what we would do  We d buy the biggest  most powerful motor car we could get  and we d tear all over the country  exceeding the speed limit  and doing everything jolly we could think of  That would be every bit as good as flying  if if we did it together  I say  Christobel do you know how to make a sentence of  together   Just three words  to get her  That s what  together  spells for me now    Miss Charteris smiled   You might have taken honours in spelling  Boy  And I am not the sort of person who enjoys exceeding speed limits  Also I am afraid I have a troublesome habit of always wanting to stop and see all there is to see    But the Boy was infinitely accommodating   Oh  we wouldn t  exceed the speed limit much  And we would stop everywhere  and see everything  You should breakfast in London  lunch at the Old White Horse  Mr  Pickwick s inn at Ipswich  have tea at the Maid s Head  beneath the shadow of Norwich Cathedral  where you could wash your hands in Queen Elizabeth s fusty old bedroom what a lot of bedrooms Queen Elizabeth slept in  and made them all fusty and have time to show me Little Boy Blue s breakwater at Dovercourt  before dinner  There s nothing like motoring     It sounds interesting  certainly   said Miss Charteris    And then   continued the Boy  in a calm business like voice   it s less expensive than flying  You run through fifty thousand a year in no time with aeroplanes  And of course we should want to open both my places  I m awfully glad I didn t  let the tenants in the old home renew their lease  As it is  they turn out in three months  Oh  I say  Christobel  I do believe it is a setting worthy of you  Have you ever seen it  The great hall  the old pictures  the oak staircase I once rode down it on my rocking horse and came to utter smash  And outside the park  the lake  the beech avenue  the rose garden  the peacocks  And a funny little old village belongs to us  Think how the people must want looking after  I believe you would like it all I really believe you would  And think  ah  just think what it would be to me  to see my own splendid wife  queen over everything in my dear jolly old home  Hullo  Hark to all the clocks  What is that striking  Seven  Oh  I say  I m dining with the Master to night  I must rush off  and change  Though I was such a bad lot  they all seem quite pleased to see me again  Really they do  Have I stayed too long      Sure      May I come to morrow      You are most awfully good to me  Good bye    And the Boy was gone  He had held her hand  in a firm  strong clasp  a second longer than the conventional handshake  his clear eyes  exactly on a level with hers  had looked at her gravely  wistfully  tenderly  and he was gone   She walked slowly up the lawn  She must write a few letters before post time  then dress for her solitary dinner   She felt a little flat  quite without cause  What could have been more satisfactory  in every way  than the Boy s visit  in spite of his absurd castles in the air  These must be tactfully demolished to morrow  To day  it was wisest just to let him talk   Poor Little Boy Blue  Instead of the walls of Jericho falling  his own castles in the air would come tumbling about his ears  Poor Little Boy Blue   She felt she had been completely mistress of the situation to day  holding it exactly as she wished it to be  There was no need to fear the remaining days   And when the seven days were over what then      She certainly felt very flat this evening  How suddenly the Boy had gone  There was still so much she wanted to say to him     And to morrow was the Professor s afternoon  Mercifully  he never stayed later than four o clock  It was to be hoped the Boy would not turn up early  But there was never any knowing what the Boy would do   She smiled as she mounted the flight of stone steps  and passed into the house   And  outside the postern gate  the Boy threw up his cap  and caught it  then started off and sprinted a hundred yards  then  turning aside  leapt a five barred gate  and made off across the fields  When he pulled up at last  in his own bedroom  he had just time to tub  shave  and wrestle with his evening clothes  He communed with himself in the few moments of enforced stillness  while he mastered his tie    That was all right   he said   I jolly well worked that all right  There was nothing to frighten her to day not a thing  Dear lips  They never trembled once  and no more turning faint  And  my Goody  how she lectured me  I wonder who s been telling her what  I know why she did it too  She wanted to feel quite sure she was bossing the show  And so she was  bless her  But I marched round  Yes  I jolly well marched round     Oh  I say  Can t  you stop where I put you   This  to his tie   Then  with her golden rose in his button hole  fastened by the pin from his flannel coat  off went the Boy to dine with the Master of his college    And the evening and the morning were the second day       THE THIRD DAY  THE BOY INVADES THE KITCHEN  The Boy sat on a corner of the kitchen table  swinging a loose leg  and watching Martha make hot buttered toast   He had arrived early  and  finding no one in the garden  had entered the house by the garden door  to pursue investigations upstairs   On the mat in the hall he saw a pair of goloshes  in the umbrella stand  a very large  badly rolled umbrella  hanging on a peg near by  a professor s cap and gown   The Boy stood stock still in the middle of the little hall  and looked at the goloshes   Then from the drawing room  through the closed door  came the voice of Miss Charteris full  clear  measured  melodious reading Greek tragedy    rrois anaid s   n t chei nean a declaimed Miss Charteris  and the Boy fled   Arrived in the kitchen  he persuaded Martha that cigarette smoke was fatal to black beetles  He went about  blowing fragrant clouds into every possible crack and cranny  Martha watched him  out of the corner of her eye  crawling along under the dresser in his immaculate white flannels  and Martha blessed her stars that her kitchen floor was so spotlessly clean  Only this morning she had remarked to Jenkins that he could very well eat his dinner off the boards  Mercifully  Jenkins tiresome man though he usually was had not taken this literally  or he might have made the floor less fit for the Boy s perambulations   Having taken all this trouble in order to establish his unquestioned right to smoke in Martha s kitchen  and to pose as a public benefactor while so doing  the Boy seated himself on the edge of the table  exactly behind Martha  lighted a fresh  Zenith   and prepared to enjoy himself   Martha glanced nervously at the smoke  issuing from cracks and holes on all sides  It gave her a feeling that the house was on fire  Of course she knew it was not  but to feel the house is on fire  is only one degree less alarming than to know it is  However  beetles are nasty things  and the condescending kindness and regard for Martha s personal comfort  which crawled about after them in white flannels  was gratifying to a degree   So Martha turned and gave the Boy one of her unusual smiles  He was very intently blowing rings  bubbles  Martha called them afterwards  when explaining them to Jenkins  but that was Martha s mistake  They were smoke rings  It was one of the Boy s special accomplishments  He was an expert at blowing rings   Presently   Martha  my duck   he said suddenly   Martha jumped   Bless us  Mr  Guy  What a name     What s the matter with it   inquired the Boy  innocently   I consider it a very nice name  and scriptural     Oh  I didn t  mean m  own name   explained Martha  more flushed than the warmth of the fire warranted   Not but what m  godfathers and godmothers might well  ave chosen me a better     Oh  don t  blame them  overmuch  Martha   said the Boy  earnestly   You see their choice was limited  If you study your catechism you will find that it had to be  N  or  M   Naomi  or  Martha   Even at that early age  they thought you favoured  Martha  rather than  Naomi   so they named you  Martha      Well I never   exclaimed Mrs  Jenkins    N  or  M   So it is  Now I never noticed that before  We live and learn  And Jenkins silly man  as always bin annoyed that they named  im  Noah   But how about when you was christened  Mr  Guy     Oh   explained the Boy  with a wave of his cigarette   I was christened a bit later than you  Martha  and  by that time  Parliament had sat in solemn convocation  and had brought in a Bill to the effect that all needless and vexatious limitations and restrictions in the Prayer Book might for the future be disregarded  The first to go was  N  or  M      Well  I never   said Martha   I wish they d ha  done it afore my time     You see   expounded the Boy  who was enjoying himself vastly  and getting the conjunction of the goloshes and the Greek play off his mind   you see  Martha  those progressive Bills  intimately affecting the whole community  of vital importance to the nation at large  are always blocked by the House of Lords  If the Commons could have had their own way  you might have been named  Lucy  or  Clara      I don t  incline to  Lucy  or  Clara   sir   said Mrs  Jenkins  decidedly   being  as they always strikes me  sickly story book sort of names  but I do like justice and a free country  I always have felt doubtful o  them Lords  since I listened to my married niece s husband  a very respectable journeyman tailor but mostly out of work  and if it s their doing that I m  Martha   well  I shall know what to do with Jenkins s vote that s all    The Boy slapped his leg and rocked   Martha  you ought to be put up to speak at political meetings  That s the whole thing in a nutshell  cause  effect  results  arguments  everything  Oh  my wig  Yes  they are a lot of old stick in the muds in the Upper House  aren t  they   pursued the Boy who had had a long line of dignified ancestors in that much abused place  had an uncle there at the present moment  and was more than likely eventually to have to sit there himself  a rotten lot of old stick in the muds  Martha  but I think they did well by you  I d give them the benefit of Jenkins s vote  I really would  I am glad they chose  M   not  N   Naomi was a widow and dismal  She never made the smallest effort to buck up  But Martha was a nice person  a bit flurried perhaps  and hot tempered  but well up in cooking  and keen on it  I like Martha    The Boy sat and meditated  Why did she read Greek plays with a person who left goloshes on the mat  and brought out an ancient umbrella with a waist  on an absolutely cloudless day    It wasn t  m  own name surprised me  Mr  Guy  sir   remarked Martha  coyly   it was the name you was pleased to hadd    The Boy pulled himself together   Eh  what  Oh   Martha  my duck   I see  I hope you don t  mind  Martha  It seemed to me rather a suitable and pretty addition to  Martha   You see  yours is a name which cannot be shortened when one feels affectionate   Sarah  can be  Sally    Amelia  can be  Milly    Caroline  can be  Carrie   but  Martha  remains  Martha  however loving people feel  What does Jenkins call you when he feels affectionate    Martha snorted   Jenkins knows  is place   she said  jerking the round lid off the stove  and putting on the kettle    Jenkins is a model   smiled the Boy   Then Martha looked round  her feminine curiosity  and perhaps a touch of jealousy  getting the better of her respectful discretion  She had seen so much  and heard so little  and she was a very old family servant    What do you call her  Mr  Guy   she asked  in a confidential whisper  with a jerk of the head toward the mulberry tree    Her   repeated the Boy  surprised  Then his whole tone softened  It was so sweet to speak her name to some one   I call her  Christobel    he said  gently   But Martha wanted to know more  Martha was woman enough to desire an unshared possession of her own  She bent over the fire  stirring it through the bars    Mr  Guy  sir  I suppose you don t  I suppose you do that is to say  sir Do you call her what you ve  been pleased to call me     Eh  what   said the Boy  vaguely    Oh  I see   Christobel  my   Oh  no  Martha  No  I don t   Not even when I feel most affectionate   Here the Boy was seized with sudden convulsions  slapped his knee noiselessly  and rocked on the kitchen table  He whispered it  in an ecstasy of enjoyment    Christobel  my duck   Oh  lor   Christobel  my duck   I hope I shall be able to resist telling her  I should have to own I had called Martha so   Christobel  my     Martha  wondering at the silence  looked round suddenly  But the Boy had that instant recovered  and was sitting gravely on the corner of the table    Martha  my duck   he said   to return to the original opening of this conversation  has Jenkins ever told you what a nice little wisp of hair you have  behind your left ear     Get along  sir   retorted Martha  fairly blushing   You re making game of me     Indeed  I m not   said the Boy  seriously   If you made it into a curl  Martha  and fastened it with an invisible pin  it would be quite too fascinating  You ask Jenkins  I say  Martha  What s a placket     A placket  sir   said Martha  on her way to fetch something from a shelf near which hung the kitchen mirror   a placket  sir  is a thing which shows when it shouldn t      I see   said the Boy   Then you couldn t  exactly go about in one  Martha  whose goloshes are those  sitting on the mat in the hall    Martha snorted   An old woman s   she said  wrathfully   The Boy considered this   And does the umbrella with the waist belong to the same old woman    Martha nodded    And the Professor s cap and gown  hanging near by    Martha hesitated    Tain t  always petticoats makes an old woman   she said  sententiously    Martha  you are pro foundly right   said the Boy   Does the Professor stay to tea     Thank goodness no  sir  We draw the line at that   cept when Miss Hann comes too     Who is Miss Hann     She s the Professor s sister   Martha hesitated  poured hot water into the silver teapot  then turned to whisper confidentially  with concentrated dislike   She s always a hegging of  em on     What a curious occupation   remarked the Boy  blowing a smoke ring   Does Miss Hann come often     No  Mr  Guy  Thanks be  she s a hinvalid     Poor Miss Hann  What s the matter with her    Martha snorted   Fancies herself too much     What a curious complaint  What are the symptoms     Fancies herself in a bath chair   said Martha  scornfully    I see   said the Boy   Oh  poor Miss Hann  I should feel very sick if I fancied myself in a bath chair  I wish I could meet Miss Hann  I should like to talk to her about the hegging on business     You d make her sit up   said Martha  with spiteful enjoyment    Oh no  I shouldn t    said the Boy   That would not be kind to an invalid  I should see that she reclined  comfortably  and then I should jolly well flatten her out    At that moment a shadow fell across the sunny window  Miss Charteris  her guest having departed  passed down the garden steps  and moved across the lawn   The Boy sprang to his feet  At sight of her  his conscience smote him that he should have thus gossiped and chaffed with old Martha  He suddenly remembered why he had originally found his way to the kitchen    Martha   he said   I want you to let me carry out the tea tray this afternoon  She doesn t  know I am here  She will think it is you or Jenkins  till she looks round  Let me carry it out  Martha  there s a duck     As you please  sir   said Martha   but if you want her to think it s Jenkins  you must put it down with a clatter  It takes a man to be clumsy    The Boy walked over to the window  The mulberry tree was not visible from the kitchen table    Don t  go there  Mr  Guy   cried Martha   Miss Christobel will see you  sir  This window  and the pantry  show from the garden  If you want to  ave a look at her  go through that door into the storeroom  The Venetian blind is always down in there  There is one crack through which I    Martha stopped short  disconcerted    One crack through which you think I could see  Thank you  Martha   said the Boy  readily   Hurry up with the tray    He went into the store room  found Martha s chink  and realized exactly what had been the extent of Martha s view  during the last two days   Then he bent his hungry young eyes on Christobel   She was seated in a garden chair  her back to the house  her face towards the postern gate in the old red wall at the bottom of the garden  The rustic table  upon which he would soon deposit the tea tray  was slightly behind and to the left of her  The sun shone through the mulberry leaves  glinting on the pure whiteness of her gown  She leaned her beautiful head back wearily  Her whole attitude betokened fatigue  He could not see her face  but he felt sure her eyes were open  and he knew her eyes were on the gate   The Boy s lips moved   Christobel   he whispered   Christobel beloved    She was waiting  and he knew she was waiting for him   Presently he dropped the lath of the Venetian blind  and turned to go  But first he took out his pocket book and fastened the lath which lifted most easily  to those above and below it  with halfpenny stamps  He knew old Martha would take a hint from him  There must be no eyes on the mulberry tree to day   In the kitchen the tray was ready  tea freshly made  thin bread and butter  cucumber sandwiches  hot buttered toast in perfection  cornflour buns  warranted to explode  all the things he liked most  and  best of all  cups for two  He grasped the tray firmly with both hands    Martha   he said   you are a jewel  I give you leave to watch me down the lawn from the kitchen window  But when I have safely arrived  turn your attention to your own tea  or I shall look up and shake my fist at your dear nice old face  And  I say  Martha  do you ever write postcards  Because  if you want any ha penny stamps  you will find some on the storeroom blind  Only  don t  want them  Martha  till this week is over  and I am gone    Whereupon the Boy lifted the tray  and made for the door   Down the lawn he bore it  and set it safely on the rustic table  He was very deft of movement  was the Boy  yet  remembering his instructions  he contrived to set it down with something of a clatter   Miss Charteris did not turn her head Her eyes  half closed beneath the long lashes  were on the postern gate    Jenkins   she said    Yes  ma am   replied the Boy  in excellent imitation of the meek tones of Jenkins    Should any one call this afternoon  Jenkins  please remember that I am not  at home      Hip  hip  hurrah   said the Boy   Then she turned and her face was all  and more than all  he had hoped it might be    Oh  Boy   she said   Oh  Boy dear    After that  it was a very happy tea  Neither had been quite natural  nor had they been really true to themselves  the day before  so the delight of meeting seemed to follow a longer parting than the actual twenty four hours  The Boy s brown eyes rested in tenderness on the hand that filled his cup  and she did not say  Don t    she merely smiled indulgently  and added the cream and sugar slowly  as if to let him do what he willed   The hum of bees was in the garden  a sense of youth was in the air  The sunbeams danced among the mulberry leaves   The Boy insisted upon carrying back the tray  to do away at once with the possibility of interruption from Jenkins  Then he drew their chairs into the deeper shade of the mulberry tree  a corner invisible from all windows  The Boy had learned a lesson while looking through the storeroom blind   There they sat and talked  in calm content  It did not seem to matter much of what they spoke  so long as they could lie back facing one another  each listening to the voice which held so much more of meaning in it than the mere words it uttered  each looking into the eyes which had now become clear windows through which shone the soul   Suddenly the Boy said   How silly we were  the other day  to talk of the relative ages of our bodies  What do they matter  Our souls are the real you and I  And our souls are always the same age  Some souls are old old from the first  I have seen an old soul look out of the eyes of a little child  and I have seen a young soul dance in the eyes of an old  old woman  You and I  thank God  have young souls  Christobel  and we shall be eternally young    He stretched his arms over his head  in utter joyful content with life    Go on  Boy dear   said Christobel   I am not sure that I agree with you  but I like to hear you talk     At first   he said   our bodies are so babyish that our souls do not find them an adequate medium of expression  But by and by our bodies grow and develop  after which come the beautiful years of perfection  ten  twenty  thirty of them  when the young soul goes strong and gay through life  clad in the strong gay young body  Then gradually  gradually  the strong young soul  in its unwearied  immortal youth  wears out the body  The body grows old  but not the soul  Nothing can age that  and when at last the body quite wears out  the young soul breaks free  and begins again  Youthful souls wear out their bodies quicker than old ones  just as a strong young boy romps through a suit of clothes sooner than a weakly old man  But there is always life more abundant  and a fuller life farther on  So the mating of souls is the all important thing  and when young souls meet and mate  what does it matter if there be a few years  difference in the ages of their bodies  Their essential youthfulness will surmount all that    Christobel looked at him  and truly for a moment the young soul in her leapt out to his  in glad response  Then the other side of the question rose before her    Ah  but  Boy dear   she said   the souls express themselves their needs  their delights  their activities through the bodies  And suppose one body  in the soul union  is wearing out sooner than the other  that is hard on the other hard on both  Boy my Little Boy Blue shall I tell you an awful secret  I suppose I sat too closely over my books at Girton  I suppose I was not sufficiently careful about good print  or good light  Anyway Boy dear I have to use glasses when I read   She looked wistfully into his bright eyes   You see  Already I am beginning to grow old   Her sweet lips trembled   In a moment he was kneeling by the arm of her chair  bending over her  as he did on the first day  but as he did not do yesterday  Suddenly she realized why she had felt so flat yesterday  after he was gone   He lifted her hand and kissed it gently  back and palm  Then he parted the third finger from the rest  with his own brown ones  and held that against his warm young lips   She drew her hand slowly away  passed it over his hair  then let it fall upon her lap  She could not speak  she could not move  she could not send him away  She wanted him so her little Boy Blue  of long ago    Old  my Beloved   he said   You old  Never  Always perfect perfect to me  And why not wear glasses  Heaps of mere kids wear glasses  and wear them all the time  Only how alarmingly clever you must look in spectacles  Christobel  It would terrify me now  but by and by it will make me feel proud  I think one would expect glasses to go with those awe inspiring classical honours  With my barely respectable B A   I daren t  lay claim to any outward marks of erudition   Then  as she did not smile  but still gazed up at him  wistfully  his look softened to still deeper tenderness   Dear eyes   he murmured   oh dear  dear eyes   and gently laid his lips on each in turn    Don t    she said  with a half sob   Ah  Boy  don t   You know you must not kiss me     Kiss you   he said  still bending over her   Do you call that kissing   Then he laughed  and the joyous love in his laughter wrung her heart   Christobel  on the seventh day  when the gates fly open  and the walls fall down  when the citadel surrenders  when you admit you are my own then I shall kiss you  then you will know what kissing really means    He bent above her  His lips were very near to hers  She closed her eyes and waited  Her own lips trembled  She knew how fearfully it tempted the Boy that her lips should tremble because his were near  yet she let them tremble  She forgot to remember the past  she forgot to consider the future  She was conscious of only one thing  that she wanted her Little Boy Blue to teach her what kissing really meant  So she closed her eyes and waited   She did not hear him go  but presently she knew he was no longer there   She opened her eyes   The Boy had walked across the lawn  and stood looking into the golden heart of an opening yellow rose  His back appeared very uncompromising  very determined  very erect   She rose and walked over to him  As she moved forward  with the graceful dignity of motion which was always hers  her mental balance returned   She slipped her hand beneath his arm   Come  Boy   she said   let us walk up and down  and talk  It is enervating to sit too long in the sunshine    He turned at once  suiting his step to hers  and they paced the lawn in silence   When they reached the postern gate the Boy stood still  Something in his look suddenly recalled her Little Boy Blue  when the sand on his small nose could not detract from the dignity of his little face  nor weaken its stern decision   He took both her hands in his  and looked into her eyes    Christobel   he said   I must go  I must go  because I dare not stay  You are so wonderful this afternoon  so dear beyond expression  I know you trust me absolutely  but this is only the third day  and I cannot trust myself  dear  So I m off    He lifted both her hands to his lips    May I go  my Queen   he said    Yes  Boy   she answered   Go    And he went   It was hard to hear the thud of the closing door  For some time she stood waiting  just on the inside  She thought he would come back  and she wished him to find her there  the moment he opened the door   But the Boy being the Boy did not come back   Presently she returned to her chair  in the shade of the mulberry tree  She lay  with closed eyes  and lived again through the afternoon  from the moment when the Boy had said   Hip  hip  hurrah   There came a time when she turned very pale  and her lips trembled  as they had done before   At length she rose and paced slowly up the lawn  On her face was the quiet calm of an irrevocable decision    To morrow   she said   I must tell the Boy about the Professor    In the middle of the night  Martha  being wakeful  became haunted by the remembrance of the smoke  as it had curled from cracks and keyholes in the kitchen  She felt constrained to put on a wonderful pink wrapper  and go creaking slowly down the stairs to make sure the house was not on fire  Martha s wakefulness was partly caused by the unusual fact of a large and hard curl paper  behind her left ear   Miss Charteris was also awake  She was not worried by memories of smoke  or visions of fire  and her soft hair was completely innocent of curl papers  But she was considering how she should tell the boy about the Professor  and that consideration was not conducive to calm slumber  She heard Martha go creaking down the stairs  and  as Martha came creaking up again  she opened her door  and confronted her    What are you doing  Martha   she said   Martha  intensely conscious of her curl paper  was about to answer with more than her usual respectful irritability  when the eyes of the two women mistress and maid met  in the light of their respective candles  and a sudden sense of fellowship in the cause of their night vigil passed between them   Martha smiled a crooked smile  half ashamed to be seen smiling  When she spoke  her aspirates fell away from her more completely than in the daytime     E went crawlin  about the kitchen   she said  in a muffled midnight whisper   all in  is white flannels  puffin  smoke in every crack an   ole to kill the beetles  So kind  e meant it  but I couldn t  sleep for wonderin  if the place was smokin  still  I  ad to go down an  see   Ow came you to be awake  Miss Christobel     Things he said in the garden  Martha  have given me food for thought  I began thinking them over  and sleep went    Martha smiled again and this time the smile came more easily    E  as a way of keepin  one on the go   she said   but we d best be gittin  to sleep now  miss   E ll be at it again to morrow  bless  is  eart   And Martha  in her pink wrapper  lumbered upwards   But the Boy  who had this disturbing effect on the women who loved him  slept soundly himself  one arm flung high above his tumbled head  And if the sweet mother  who perforce had had to let her dying arms slip from about her baby boy  almost before his little feet could carry him across a room  saw from above the pure radiance on his lips and brow as he slept  she must have turned to the Emerald Throne with glad thanksgiving for the answer vouchsafed to a dead mother s prayers    And the evening and the morning were the third day       THE FOURTH DAY  CHRISTOBEL SIGNS HER NAME   I am exhausted   said the Boy  reaching out a long arm  and securing his third piece of hot buttered toast   I am ruffled  My usual calm mental poise is overthrown and on the Sabbath  of all days  Every feather I possess has been rubbed up the wrong way   He lay back in the depths of his chair  stretched out his legs  and looked dejectedly at Christobel   Her quiet smile enveloped him  Her look was as a cool touch on a hot forehead    Poor Little Boy Blue  I thought something was wrong  I should feel a keener anxiety  were the hot buttered toast less obviously consoling     I ll jolly well never go again   said the Boy  with indignation   Not me     Before you were born  Boy  when I went to school   said Miss Charteris   we were taught to say  Not I   And if you were to tell me where you have been  on this Sabbath afternoon  I might be able to give you more intelligent sympathy     I ve  been to a drawing room meeting   said the Boy   and I ve  heard a woman hold forth  For an hour and a quarter  I ve  sat stuffed up  breathing the atmosphere of other people s go to meeting clothes  and heard a good lady go meandering on  while I had no room for my legs     I thought you seemed finding them extra long  Boy  Why did you go to a drawing room meeting     I went   said the Boy   because the dear old thing in whose house it was held asked me to go  She used to know my mother  When I was at Trinity she looked me up  often invited me to her charming home  gave me excellent little dinners  followed by the kindest  nicest  most nervous little preachments  Don t  look amused  dear  I never failed to profit  I respected her for it  She is as good and genuine as they make  em  and if she had stood up this afternoon  with her friendly smile  and dear shaky old voice  and given us an exposition of the twenty third Psalm  we should have all come away quite  good and happy   Instead of which oh  my wig    The Boy took an explosive bun  and put it whole into his mouth   The only way to manage them on Sunday   he explained  as soon as speech was possible   when sweeping is not the right thing  But let us hope Mollie s papa s  clerical brethren  won t  find it out  There would certainly be less conversation and fewer crumbs  but no fun at all     I don t  think you need be afraid  Boy dear  Even should such a way out of the difficulty occur to them  I am inclined to think they would prefer the explosion  to the whole bun at a mouthful  It has a rather startling effect  you know  until one gets used to seeing it done  I can t  quite imagine an archdeacon doing it  while standing on the hearthrug in conversation with my brother  Now tell me what the good lady said  which you found so trying     Oh  she meandered on   grumbled the Boy   She told us all we should have been  if we had not been what we were  and all we might be  if we were not what we are  and all we shall be  when we are not what we are  She implored us to consider  and weigh well  where we should go  if  by a sudden and unexpected dispensation of Providence  we ceased to be where we then were  I jolly well knew the answer to that  for if Providence had suddenly dispensated which it didn t   for a good three quarters of an hour I should have been here  here  HERE  as fast as my best Sunday boots could carry me   His brown eyes softened   Ah  think what  here  means   he said   Think   Here  means You    But Miss Charteris did not wish the conversation to become too meltingly personal    What else did she say  Boy    He consulted the mulberry leaves  then bounded in his chair   Ha  I have it  I kept this tit bit for you  She used an astronomical illustration  I haven t  the least idea apropos of what  but she told us exactly how many millions of miles the sun is from the earth  and then she smiled upon us blandly  and said   Or is it billions   Think of that  She said   Or is it billions   in exactly the same tone of voice as she might have said of the bonnet she had on   I bought it  at a sale  for elevenpence three farthings  or was it a shilling      Oh  Boy  you really are naughty  I never connected you with personal sarcasm     Yes  but that sort of woman shouldn t    complained the Boy   And with half Cambridge sitting listening   Millions  or is it billions   Oh lor     Poor thing   remarked Miss Charteris   She could not have known that she had in the audience a person who had only just avoided the drawback to future enterprise  of being Senior Wrangler  Had she realized that  she would have been more careful with her figures     Tease away   said the Boy   I don t  care  now I am safe here  Only I shan t  tell you any more     I don t  want to hear any more  Boy  I always enjoy appreciations  even of things I do not myself appreciate  But non appreciations do not appeal to me  If a person has meant to be effective and proved inadequate  or tried to do good and done harm  I would rather not know it  unless I can help to put matters right  Have some more tea  Boy  and then I want to talk to you myself  I have something rather special to tell you    The Boy stood up and brought his cup to the little table  When she had filled it  he knelt on one knee beside her  his elbow on the arm of her chair  and drank his tea there    I am sorry  dear   he said  presently   I won t  do it again  Perhaps I listened wrong  because I was bored at being there at all  I say  Christobel it has just occurred to me did you know my mother    The old garden was very still  A hush  as of the Paradise of God  seemed suddenly to fall upon it  As the Boy asked his quiet question  a spirit seemed to hover  between them and the green dome of mulberry leaves above them  smoothing the Boy s tumbled hair  and touching the noble brow of the woman the Boy loved  a gentle  watching  thankful spirit eternally remembering  and tenderly glad to be remembered  For a few moments the silence was a silence which could not be broken  The Boy lifted wondering eyes to the moving leaves  Christobel laid her hand upon his  as it gripped her chair  An unseen voice seemed to whisper to the Boy not in the stern tones of the Church  but as an eager  anxious  question   Wilt thou have this woman to be thy wedded wife   And silently the Boy replied   Please God  I will   and  bending  kissed the hand resting on his   The spell lifted  Christobel spoke    Yes  Boy dear  I knew her  I have often wondered whether I might tell you  She and my mother were dear friends  I was thirteen when she died  You were three  poor Little Boy Blue  Two things I specially remember about your mother  the peculiar radiance of her face a light from within  shining out  and the fact that when she was in a room the whole atmosphere seemed rarefied  beautified  uplifted  I think she lived very near heaven  Boy  and  like Enoch  she walked straight in one day  and came back no more  She  was not   for God took her    Another long holy silence  The mulberry leaves were still  Then the Boy said  softly   Some day  will you tell me heaps more details lots of little things about her  No one ever has  But I seem almost to begin to remember her  when you talk of her  Meanwhile  may I show you this    He drew from the inner pocket of his coat  a small well worn pocket Bible  Opening it at the fly leaf  he passed it to Miss Charteris    It was hers   he said   She bent over it and read the inscription   M  A  Chelsea   Through faith and patience inherit the promises    Below  in a delicate writing  traced by a hand that trembled   To my Baby Boy from his Mother   I have prayed for thee  that thy faith fail not    She looked at it in silence  How much had this book meant during all these years  to the  Baby Boy   Had the book in his pocket  and the prayers hovering about him  something to do with the fact that he was still just Little Boy Blue   The Boy had taken a fountain pen from his pocket  and was shaking it vigorously over the grass   Now he passed it to her    Write your dear name beneath   he said   Infinitely touched  she made no comment  raised no question  She took the pen  and wrote just  Christobel     And the evening and the morning were the fourth day       THE FIFTH DAY  GUY CHELSEA TAKES CONTROL   Now  Sir Boy   said Miss Charteris with decision   this is your fifth day  Our time is nearly over  You have done most of the talking  You have had things entirely your own way  What      Oh  well  almost entirely your own way  I have allowed you to play your Old Testament game to your heart s content  With commendable adaptability  I have been Jericho  and you have marched round  I have been Jericho in my own garden  and have refreshed the invading army with hot buttered toast and explosive buns  Now it is my turn to take the initiative  Jenkins having removed the tea  and it being too hot for tennis  I am going to ask you to sit still  while I explain to you quite clearly why I must send you away at the close of the seventh day    She tried to hide her extreme trepidation beneath a tone of gay banter  She hoped it did not sound as forced to him as it did to herself  The Boy s clear eyes were fixed upon her  Had he noticed the trembling of her hands  before she steadied them by laying hold of the arms of her chair    So now for a serious talk  if you please  Sir Boy     Excuse me  dear   said the Boy   the Israelites were not allowed to parley     You need not parley   said Miss Charteris   you are requested merely to listen  You may smoke if you like  I understand cigarette smoke is fatal to black beetles  Possibly it has the same effect on garden insects  Russell tells me we are overrun by snails  Smoke  Boy  if you like     Dear   said the Boy  his head thrown back  his hands thrust deep into his coat pockets   I never have the smallest desire to smoke in your presence  I should feel as if I were smoking in church     Oh  you dear amazing altogether absurd boy  Don t  look at me like that  And don t  say such unexpected things  or I shall be unable to parley satisfactorily     When I went to school   remarked the Boy   and you were an engaging little girl in a pigtail  I was taught to say   Do not look at me thus   at least  masters frequently appeared to think it necessary to make that remark to me  I can t  imagine why  because they were not specially worth looking at  excepting that a very large person  in a very angry condition  always presented a spectacle of extreme interest to my juvenile mind  It was so fascinating to watch and see what they would do next  They were like those wooden monkeys and bears you buy in Swiss shops  don t  you know  You pull a hanging string  and their legs and arms jump about unexpectedly  One always felt a really angry grown up was a mere puppet  Unseen fingers were pulling the string  and it was funny to watch  There was an exciting element of danger  too  because sometimes a hand jerked up and boxed your ears     Little Boy Blue   she said   it must have been quite impossible ever to be mildly angry with you  Either one would have waxed impotently furious  or one would have wanted to to hug you    The Boy leapt up    Sit down   said Miss Charteris   or I shall send you away  And I do not wish to do that  because I have quite made up my mind to tell you to day  a thing which I suppose I ought to have told you long ago  and I tried to do so  Boy  but somehow you always made it impossible  I want to to tell you about the Professor   She paused   It was so very difficult  It was like rolling a heavy stone up a steep hill  And the Boy made no attempt to help her  He lay back with an exaggerated display of resignation  He looked at her with sleepy  amused eyes  And he asked no questions  The army of Israel obviously declined to parley    I have long felt I ought to tell you about the Professor   continued Miss Charteris   The Boy sighed   I think I jolly well know all there is to know about professors   he said    Not about this one   explained Miss Charteris   He is my Professor     Oh  if he s your Professor   said the Boy  sitting up   of course I am interested  But I am not sure that I approve of you having a tame Professor  especially when it arrives in goloshes  and leaves them in the hall     I am afraid nobody will ask whether you approve or not  Little Boy Blue  The Professor has been a great friend of mine during nearly twelve years  and I think I am possibly in fact  very probably going to marry the Professor     Really   said the Boy   May I ask when he proposed     He has not proposed  Boy    The Boy produced his pocket book  took out a calendar  and studied it attentively    Then I m afraid you will have some time to wait   he said   It will not be leap year again until         This sounded impertinent  but the Boy could no more have been guilty of intentional impertinence toward her  than he could have picked her pocket  and Miss Charteris knew it  There was one thing of which those who had dealings with Christobel Charteris could always be sure absolute justice  She had seen the Boy s face whiten suddenly  to a terrible pallor  beneath his tan  She knew he was making a desperate fight for self control  How best could she help  Her own part seemed almost more than she could manage    Come here  Boy dear   she said  holding out her hand   He hesitated one instant  then rose unsteadily to his feet  and came not to his usual place at the side  bending over her  but in front of her  on one knee  silently waiting   She bent forward   Take my hand  Boy    He took it  in a firm unhesitating clasp  They held each other so  in silence  The colour came back into the Boy s face  The dumb horror died out of his eyes  They smiled into hers again    Now promise me  Boy dear  that you will let me tell you all  and that you will try not to misunderstand     My dearest   said the Boy   I promise  But I do not need to say I will try not to misunderstand  I could not misunderstand you  if I tried     Then go back to your chair  Boy    He went  His eyes were bright again    Boy  please to understand that I am not engaged to the Professor  Of course  had that been the case  I should have told you  long ago  He has never said one word to me of love or marriage  But he has been a great friend an intimate friend  intellectually  and I have reason to know that he wishes has wished for years a good deal more than he has ever expressed to me  He has waited  Boy  and when anybody has waited nearly twelve years  could one fail them     Why  of course   cried the Boy  eagerly   If a man could wait twelve years good heavens  why shouldn t  he wait twenty  A man has no business to wait  or to be able to wait  or to keep a woman waiting  Twelve years  Oh  I say  I didn t  wait twelve days  Now  did I    She smiled   You break all speed records  Boy  always  But cannot you understand that all men have not fifty thousand a year  and the world at their feet  Had you been penniless  Boy  you even you would have had to wait     Not a bit   said the Boy  stoutly   I would drive a cab  I would sweep a crossing  I would do anything  or be anything  but I wouldn t  wait for the woman I loved  nor would I  his voice dropped almost to a whisper  keep the woman who loved me  waiting     But suppose she had a comfortable little income of her own  and you had less much less to offer her  Surely  Boy  proper pride would keep you from asking her to marry you  until your income at least equalled hers     Not a bit   said the Boy   That sort of rot isn t  proper pride  It s just selfish false pride  However much a woman had  when a man a man  mind you  not an old woman  or a thing with no pluck or vertebra when a man gives a woman his whole love  his whole life  the worship of his whole body  heart  and soul  he has given her that which no money could buy  and were she a millionairess she would still be poor if  from false pride  he robbed her of that gift which was his to give her and perhaps his alone     Boy dear   she said  gently   it sounds very plausible  But it is so easy to be plausible with fifty thousand a year in the background  Let me tell you about the Professor  He has  of course  his fellowship  and is quite comfortably off now  living as a bachelor  in rooms  But he practically supports his unmarried sister  considerably older than himself  who lives in a tiny little villa  and keeps one maid  The Professor could not afford to marry  and set up a larger establishment  on his present income  at least he apparently thinks he could not  And your theory of robbing the woman who the woman he loves  does not appear to have occurred to him  But  during all these years he has been compiling an Encyclopedia I don t  suppose you know what an Encyclopedia is  Boy     Oh  don t  I   said the Boy   It s a thing you pile up on the floor to stand upon when you want to fix a new pipe rack    Miss Charteris ignored this trying definition of an Encyclopedia    The Professor is compiling a wonderful book   she said  with dignity   and  when it is completed and published  he will be in a position to marry     Has he told you so   inquired the Boy    No  Boy  He has never mentioned the subject of marriage to me  But he has told his sister  and she has told me     Ha   said the Boy   Miss Hann  I suppose  I must say  I distrust Miss Hann     What do you know of Miss Ann   inquired Christobel  astonished    Only that she s always a hegging of  em on   said the Boy  calmly   The indignant blood rushed into the fair proud face    Boy  You ve  been gossiping with Martha     I have  dear  I admit it  You see  I arrived early  on the third day  found the garden empty  went gaily into the house to look for you  Ran up into the hall  when up got a pair of old goloshes eh  what  Oh  sorry up got a pair of new goloshes  and hit me in the eye  A professor s cap and gown hung up  as if at home  and while I meditated upon these things  the voice of my Beloved was uplifted in loud and sonorous Greek  exclaiming   Avaunt  rash youth  Thou impudent intruder   Can you wonder that I avaunted to Martha     You will please tell me at once all Martha said to you     Of course I will  dear  Don t  be vexed  I always meant to tell you  some time or other  I asked her whose were the goloshes  the umbrella with the er decided figure  the suspended cap and gown  Martha said they were the Professor s  I inquired whether the Professor stayed to tea  You really can t  blame me for asking that  because I had gone to the kitchen for the express purpose of carrying out the tea tray  yours and mine  but not the Professor s  No possible pleasure could have resulted  either to you  or to me  or to the Professor  from my unexpected appearance with the tea tray  if the Professor had been there  Now could it  I think it would be nice of you  dear  and only fair  if  remembering the peculiar circumstances of that afternoon  you just said   No  it couldn t      Well  I asked Martha whether the Professor stayed to tea  and heard that  Thank goodness  no   we drew the line at that  except when Miss Hann came too  With the awful possibility of Miss Hann  coming too   on one of my priceless days  I naturally desired a little light thrown on Miss Hann  I was considerably relieved to learn that Miss Hann suffers from the peculiar complaint mental  I gather of  fancying herself in a bath chair   This might be no hindrance to the  hegging on  propensities  but it certainly diminished the chances of the  coming too   That was all  dear     Boy  you ought to have been ashamed of yourself     So I was  the moment I saw you walk down the lawn  But you really needn t  look so indignant  I was working for you  at the same time     Working for me     Yes  dear  I told Martha her wisps would look nicer if she curled them  I also suggested  invisible pins   If you like I will tell you how I came to know about  invisible pins   but it is a very long story  and not specially interesting  for the lady in the case was my great aunt     Oh  Boy   said Miss Charteris  laughing in spite of herself   I wish you were the size of my Little Boy Blue on the sands at Dovercourt  I would dearly like to shake you     Well   he said   you did more than shake me  just now  You gave me about the worst five minutes I ever had in my life  Christobel  You don t  really care about the Professor     Boy  dear  I really do  I have cared about him very much  for years     Yes  as a woman loves a book  but not as a woman loves a man     Explain your meaning  please     Oh  hang it all   exclaimed the Boy  violently   Do you love his mouth  his eyes  his hair    The Boy choked  and stopped short   Miss Charteris considered  and replied with careful deliberation   I do not know that I have ever seen his mouth  he wears a beard  His eyes are not strong  but they look very kind through his glasses  His hair  Well  really  he has not much to speak of  But all these things matter very little  His mind is great and beautiful  his thoughts appeal to me  I understand his way of viewing things  he understands mine  It would be a wonderful privilege to be able to make life easy and happy for one for whom I have so profound a respect and esteem  I have looked upon it  during the last few years  as a privilege which is  eventually  to be mine     Christobel   cried the Boy   it is wrong  it is terrible  It is not the highest  I can t  stand it  and I won t   I will not let you give yourself to a wizened old bookworm     Be quiet  Boy   she said  sharply   Do you wish to make me really angry  The Professor is not old  He is only fourteen years my senior  To your extreme youth  fifty may seem old  The Professor is in his prime  I am afraid we have nothing to gain  Boy  by prolonging this discussion     But we can t  leave it at this   said the Boy  desperately   Where do I come in     My Little Boy Blue  I am afraid you don t  come in at all  excepting as a very sweet idyll which  all through the years to come  I shall never forget  You begged for your seven days  and I gave them  But I never led you to assume I could say  Yes   Now listen  Boy  and I will tell you the honest truth  I do not know that I am ever going to marry the Professor  I only feel pledged to him from the vague belief that we each consider the other is waiting  Don t  break your heart over it  Boy  because it is more than likely it will never come to pass  But even were there no Professor oh  Boy dear  I could not marry you  I love my Little Boy Blue more tenderly and deeply than I have ever before loved anything or any one on this earth  But I could not marry a boy  however dearly I loved him  however sweet was his love to me  I am a woman grown  and I could surrender myself wholly  only to a man who would wholly be my mate and master  I cannot pretend to call my Little Boy Blue  the man I love   because he is really dearest to me when I think of him  with expectation in his baby eyes  trotting down the sands to find his cannon ball     Oh  Boy  I am hurting you  I hate to hurt you  Boy  Your love is so beautiful  Nothing as perfect will ever touch my life again  Yet I cannot  honestly  give what you ask     Boy dear  ought I to have told you  quite plainly  sooner  If so  you must forgive me    The Boy had risen  and stood before her   You always do the right thing   he said   and never  under any circumstances  could there be anything for me to forgive you  I have been an egregious young ass  I have taken things for granted  all along the line  What must you think of me  Why should you care  You  with your intellectual attainments  your honours  your high standing in the world of books  Why should you care  Christobel  Why should you care    He stood before her  straight and tall and desperately implacable  The exuberant youth had died out of his face  For the first time  she could not see in him her Little Boy Blue    Why should you care   he said again   She rose and faced him   But I do care  Boy   she said   How dare you pretend to think I don t   I care very tenderly and deeply     Pooh   said the Boy   Do you suppose I wished you to marry a bare toed baby  with sand on its nose   He laughed wildly  paused and looked at her  then laughed again   A silly little ass that said it didn t  like girls  Oh  I say  I think it s about time I was off  Will you walk down to the gate      Thanks  You are always most awfully good to me  I say  Miss Charteris  may I ask the Professor s name     Harvey   she said  quietly   Kenrick Harvey   The dull anguish at her heart seemed almost more than she could bear  Yet what could she say or do  He was merely accepting her own decision    Harvey   he said   Why of course I know him  He s not much to look at  is he  But we always thought him an awfully good sort  and kind as they make  em  We considered him a confirmed bachelor  but well  we didn t  know he was waiting    They had reached the postern gate  Oh  would he see the growing pain in her eyes  What was she losing  What had she lost  Why did her whole life seem passing out through that green gate    Good bye   he said   and please forget all the rot I talked about Jericho  It goes with the spade and bucket  and all the rest  You have been most awfully kind to me  all along  But the very kindest thing you can do now  is to forget all the impossible things I thought and said    Allow me     I ll shut the door    He put up his hand  to lift his cap  but he was bareheaded  He laughed again  turned  and passed out    Boy  Boy  Come back   said Christobel  But the door had closed on the first word   She stood alone   This time she did not wait  Where was the good of waiting   She turned and walked slowly up the lawn  pausing to look at the flowers in the border  The yellow roses still looked golden  The jolly little  what d  you call  ems  lifted pale purple faces to the sky   But the Boy was gone   She reached her chair  where he had placed it  deep in the shade of the mulberry tree  She felt tired  worn out  old   The Boy was gone   She leaned back with closed eyes  She had hurt him so  She remembered all the glad  sweet confident things he had said each day  Now she had hurt him so     What radiant faith  in love and in life  had been his  But she had spoiled that faith  and dimmed that brightness   Suddenly she remembered his dead mother s prayer for him   I have prayed for thee  that thy faith fail not   And under those words she had written  Christobel   Would he want to obliterate that name  No  she knew he would not  Nothing approaching a hard or a bitter thought could ever find a place in his heart  It would always be the golden heart of her little Boy Blue   Tears forced their way beneath her closed lashes  and rolled slowly down her cheeks    Oh  Boy dear   she said aloud   I love you so I love you so     I know you do  dear   he said   It s almost unbelievable yet I know you do    She opened her eyes  The Boy had come back  She had not heard his light step  on the springy turf  He knelt in his favourite place  on the left of her chair  and bent over her  Once more his face was radiant  His faith had not failed   She looked up into his shining eyes  and the joy in her own heart made her dizzy    Boy dear   she whispered   not my lips  because I am not altogether yours I may have to you know  the Professor  But  oh Boy  I can t  help it  I m afraid I care terribly    He was quite silent  yet it seemed to her that he had shouted  A burst of trumpet triumph seemed to fill the air   He bent lower   Of course I wouldn t   Christobel   he said   not before the seventh day  But there s a lot beside lips  and it s all so dear    Then she felt the Boy s kisses on her hair  on her brow  on her eyes   Dear eyes   he said   shedding tears for my pain  Ah  dear eyes   And he kissed them again   She put up her hand  to push him gently away  He captured it  and held it to his lips    Stop  Boy dear   she said   Be good now  and sit down    He slipped to the grass at her feet  and rested his head against her knee   She stroked his hair  with gentle  tender touch  Her Little Boy Blue had come back to her  Oh  bliss unutterable  Why worry about the future    How silly we were  dear   he said   How silly to suppose we could part like that you and I   Then his sudden merry laugh rang out oh  such music  such sweet music   I say  Christobel   he said   it is all very well now to say  Stop  and be good   But on the seventh day  when the walls fall down  and I march up into the citadel  I shall give you millions of kisses or will it be billions     Judging from my knowledge of you  Boy dear   she said   I rather think it would be billions    Later  as they stood once more by the postern gate  he turned  framed in the doorway  smiling a last gay good bye   It was their second parting that day  and how different from the first  There was to be a third  unlike either  before the day was over  but its approach was  as yet  unsuspected   But as he stood in the doorway  full in a shaft of sunlight  the glad certainty in his eyes smote her with sudden apprehension    Oh  Boy dear   she said   take care  You are building castles again  They will tumble about our ears  I haven t  promised you anything  Little Boy Blue of mine  and I am afraid I shall have to marry the Professor     If you do  dear   he said   I shall have to give him a new umbrella as a wedding present   And the Boy went whistling down the lane   But  out of sight of the postern gate and of the woman who  leaning against it  watched him to the turning  he dropped his bounding step and jaunty bearing  His face grew set and anxious  his walk  perplexed    Oh  God   said the Boy  as he walked   don t  let me lose her    A few minutes later  a telegram was put into his hand from the friend left on the coast  in charge of his newest aeroplane    Arrange Channel flight  if possible  day after to morrow     Not I   said the Boy  crumpling the message into his pocket   The day after to morrow is the seventh day    He was dining with friends  but an unaccountable restlessness seized him during the evening  He made his excuses  and returned to the Bull Hotel soon after nine o clock  The hall porter at once handed him a note  left by special messenger  ten minutes earlier  It was marked  urgent   The handwriting was Christobel s   The Boy flung away his cigarette  tore the note open  and turned to a light  It was very short and clear     Boy dear  I must see you at once  You will find me in the garden    Christobel    When the Boy had turned the corner and disappeared  Miss Charteris passed through the little postern gate  and moved slowly up the lawn  Ah  how different to her sad return from that gate an hour before   The William Allen Richardsons still opened their golden hearts to the sunset  The jolly little  what d  you call  ems  still lifted their purple faces to the sky  But instead of stabbing her with agony  they sang a fragrant psalm of love   Ah  why was the Boy so dear  Why was the Boy so near  She had watched him go striding down the lane  yet he still walked beside her  his gay young laugh of glad content was in her ears  his pure young kisses on her brow and eyes  his head against her knee   Just as she reached the mulberry  Jenkins hastened from the house  The note he brought  in a familiar handwriting  thin and pointed  was marked  urgent  in one corner  and  immediate  in the other  but Miss Ann s notes usually were one or other  This happened to be both    You need not wait  Jenkins   she said   She stood close to a spreading branch of the mulberry  Her tall head was up among the moving leaves  Whispering  they caressed her  Something withheld her from entering the soft shade  sacred to herself and the Boy  She stood  to read Ann Harvey s letter   As she read  every vestige of colour left her face  Bending over the letter  she might have been a sorely troubled and perplexed replica of the noble Venus of Milo   Folding the letter  she went slowly up the lawn  still wearing that white look of cold dismay  She spoke to Martha through the open window  keeping her face out of sight    Martha   she said   I am obliged to go immediately to Miss Ann  If I am not back by eight o clock  I shall be remaining with her for dinner   She passed on  and Martha turned to Jenkins   By the way  Jenkins was having an unusually festive time  During the last twenty four hours  Martha had been kinder to him than he had ever known her to be  He was now comfortably ensconced in the Windsor armchair in a corner of the kitchen  reading yesterday s daily paper  and enjoying his pipe  Never before had his pipe been allowed in the kitchen  but he had just been graciously told he might bring it in  if he wouldn t  be  messy with the hashes   Mrs  Jenkins volunteering the additional remarkable information  that it was  good for the beetles   Jenkins was doubtful as to whether this meant that his pipe gave pleasure to the beetles  or the reverse  but experience had taught him that a condition of peaceful uncertainty in his own mind was to be preferred to a torrent of vituperative explanation from Martha  He therefore also received in silence the apparently unnecessary injunction not to go  crawlin  about all over the floor   it took  a figure to do that    Eight o clock came  and Miss Charteris had not returned    Remaining with  er for dinner   pronounced Martha  flinging open the oven  and wrathfully relegating to the larder the chicken she had been roasting with extreme care   an  a precious poor dinner it ll be  Jenkins  you may  ave this sparrow grass  I  aven t  the  eart  An  me  oping she d  ave  ad the sense to keep  im to dinner  knowing as there was a chicking an   grass for two  Now what s took Miss Hann  urgent and immediate   I d like to know   continued Martha  deriving considerable comfort from banging the plates and tumblers on to the kitchen table  with just as much violence as was consistent with their personal safety  as she walked round it  laying the table for supper   Ate a biscuit  I should think  an  flown to  er cheat  I ve  no patience  no  that I  aven t    And Martha attacked the loaf  with fury   At a quarter before nine  Miss Charteris returned  In a few moments the bell summoned Jenkins  The note he was to take was also marked  Immediate   He left it on the kitchen table  and  while he changed his coat  Martha fetched her glasses  Then she followed him to the pantry     Ere  run man   she said   run  Never mind your muffler  Who wants a muffler in June   E s in it  It s something more than a biscuit  Drat that woman    A quarter of an hour later  a tall white figure moved noiselessly down the lawn  to the seats beneath the mulberry  The full moon was just rising above the high red wall  gliding up among the trees  huge and golden through their branches  Christobel Charteris waited in the garden for the Boy   He came   By then  the lawn was bathed in moonlight  She saw him  tall and slim  in the conventional black and white of a man s evening dress  pass silently through the postern gate  She noted that he did not bang it  He came up the lawn slowly for him  He wore no hat  and every clear cut feature of the clean shaven young face showed up in the moonlight   At the mulberry  he paused  uncertain  peering into the dark shadow    Christobel   he said  softly    Boy dear  I am here  Come    He came  feeling his way among the chairs  and moving aside a table  which stood between   He found her  sitting where he had found her  on his return  three hours before  A single ray of moonlight pierced the thick foliage of the mulberry  and fell across her face  He marked its unusual pallor  He stood before her  put one hand on each arm of her chair  and bent over her    What is it   he said  softly   What is it  dear heart  It is so wonderful to be wanted  and sent for  But let me know quickly that you are not in any trouble    She looked up at him dumbly  during five  ten  twenty seconds  Then she said   Boy  I have something to tell you  Will you help me to tell it     Of course I will   he said   How can I help best     I don t  know   she answered   Oh  I don t  know    He considered a moment  Then he sat down on the grass at her feet  and leaned his head against her knees  She passed her fingers softly through his hair    What happened after I had gone   asked the Boy    Jenkins brought me a note from Miss Harvey  asking me to come to her at once  to hear some very wonderful news  intimately affecting herself  and the Professor  and and me  She wrote very ecstatically and excitedly  poor dear  She always does  Of course  I went     Well   said the Boy  gently  The pause was so very long  that it seemed to require supplementing  He felt for the other hand  which had been holding the lace at her breast  and drew it to his lips  It was wet with tears   The Boy started  He sat up  turned  resting his arm upon her lap  and tried to see her face    Go on  dear   he said   Get it over     Boy   said Miss Charteris   a rich old uncle of the Harveys has died  leaving the Professor a very considerable legacy  sufficient to make him quite independent of his fellowship  and of the production of the Encyclopedia     Well     They are very happy about it  naturally  Poor Ann is happier than I have ever seen her  And the chief cause of their joy appears to be that now the Professor is  at last  in a position to marry     Well     I have not seen him yet  but Miss Ann is full of it  She told me a good many very touching things  I had no idea it had meant so much to him all these years  Boy dear     Yes     I shall have to marry the Professor    No answer    I don t  know how to make you understand why I feel so bound to them  They were very old friends of my father and mother  They were so good to me through all the days of sorrow  when I was left alone  Miss Ann is a great invalid  and very dependent upon love and care  and upon not being thwarted in her little hopes and plans  She expects to come and live in in her brother s home  She knows I should love to have her  And he has done so much for me  intellectually  so patiently kept my mind alive  when it was inclined to stagnate  and working  when it would have grown slack  He has given up hours of his valuable time to me  every week  for years    No answer   Suddenly the moonlight  through an opening in the mulberry leaves  fell upon his upturned face  She saw the anguish in his eyes  She turned his head away  resting it against her knee  and clasped her hands upon it    Boy dear  it is terribly hard for us  I know  In a most extraordinary way in a way I cannot understand you have won my body  It yearns to be with you  it aches if you suffer  it lives in your gladness  it grows young in your youth  Nobody else has ever made me feel this  I do not suppose anybody else ever will  But oh Boy bodies are not everything  Bodies are the least of all  And I think I think the Professor holds my mind  He won it long ago  I have grown much older since then  and very tired of waiting  But I can look back to the time when I used to think the greatest privilege in the world would be  to be the to marry the Professor    She paused  and waited    Bodies count   said the Boy  in a low voice   You ll jolly well find  that bodies count    It was such a relief to hear him speak at last    Oh  I know  Boy dear   she said   But more between some  than others  The Professor and I are united  primarily  on the mental and spiritual plane  Being so sure of this  realizing the difference  makes it less hard  in a way  to to give up my Little Boy Blue  Boy dear  you must help me  because I love you as I have never loved anybody else in this world before  as I know I never shall love again  But I am bound in honour not to disappoint the man who knows I have waited for him  Miss Ann admitted to me to night that she has told him  She said  in the first moments of joy she had to tell him  he was so anxious  and so diffident  Boy dear  had it not been for that  I think I should have begged off  But as he knows as they have trusted me dear  we must say  good bye  to night  He is going to write to me to morrow  asking if he may come  I shall say   Yes       Boy dear  Is it very hard      Oh  can t  you see where duty comes in  There can be no true happiness if one has failed to be true to what one knows is just and right     Can t  you realize  Boy  that they have been everything to me for seven years  You have come in  for seven days     Time is nothing   said the Boy  suddenly   You and I are one  Christobel  eternally  indissolubly one  You will find it out  when it is too late  Age is nothing  Time is nothing  Love is all    She hesitated  The Boy s theories were so vital  so vigorous  so assured  Was she making a mistake  There was no question as to the pain involved by her decision  but was that pain to result as she believed  in higher good to all  or was it to mean irreparable loss  The very knowledge that her body so yearned for him  led her to emphasize the fact that the Boy could not oh surely could not be a fit mate for her mind  Yet he was so confident  so sure of himself  in regard to her  on every point  so unhesitatingly certain that they were meant for each other   And then she saw Ann Harvey  with clasped hands  saying   Darling child  forgive me  but I had to tell Kenrick  He is so humble he was so diffident  so doubtful of his own powers of attraction  I had to tell him that I knew you had been very fond of him for years  I did not say much  sweet child  but just enough to give dear Kenrick hope and confidence    She could see Miss Ann s delicate wrinkled face  the tearful eyes  the lavender ribbons on her lace cap  the mysterious hair brooch  fastening the old lace at her neck  The scene was photographed upon her memory  for  in that moment  Hope the young Hope  born of the youthful Boy and his desires had died  Christobel Charteris had taken up the burden of life  a life apart from the seven days  romance  created by the amazing over confidence of her Little Boy Blue   The masterful man attracts  but  in the end  it is usually the diffident man who wins  The innate unselfishness of the noblest type of woman  causes her to yield more readily to the insistence of her pity than to the force of her desire  In these cases  marriage and martyrdom are really though unconsciously synonymous  and the same pure  holy courage which went smiling to the stake  goes smiling to the altar  Does a martyr s crown await it  in another world  Possibly  The only perplexing question  in these cases  being  What awaits the wrecked life of  the other man    Christobel Charteris had put her hand to the plough  she would not look back    Little Boy Blue   she said   you must say  good bye  and go  I am going to marry the Professor quite soon  and I must not see you again  Say  good bye   Boy dear    Then the Boy s anguish broke through all bounds  He flung his arms around her  and hid his face in her lap  A sudden throb of speechless agony seemed to overwhelm them both  submerging all arguments  all casuistry  all obligations to others  in a molten ocean of love and pain   Then she heard the Boy pray   O God  give her to me  Give her to me  O God  give her to me     Hush  Boy   she said   oh  hush    He was silent at once   Then bending  she gathered him to her  holding his face against her breast  sheltering him in the tenderness of her arms  He had never seemed so completely her own Little Boy Blue as in that moment  when she listened to his hopeless prayer   O God  give her to me   This was the Little Boy Blue who tried to carry cannon balls  who faced the world  with sand upon his nose  cloudless faith in his bright eyes  indomitable courage in his heart  She forgot the man s estate to which he had attained  she forgot the man s request to which she had given a final denial  She held him as she had first longed to do  when his nurse  in unreasonable wrath  shook him on the sands  she rocked him gently to and fro  as his dead mother might have done  long years ago   Oh  my Little Boy Blue  my Little Boy Blue   she said   Suddenly she felt the Boy s hot tears upon her neck   Then  in undreamed of pain  her heart stood still  Then the full passion of her tenderness awoke  and found voice in an exceeding bitter cry    Oh  I cannot bear it  I cannot bear it  Boy dear  oh  Boy dear  you shall have all you wish all all      Do you hear  my Little Boy Blue  It shall all be for you  darling  all for you  Nobody else matters  You shall have all you want all all all    Silence under the mulberry tree  the silence of a great decision   Then he drew himself gently but firmly from her arms   He stood before her  tall  erect  unbending  The moonlight fell upon his face  It had lost its look of youth  taking on a new power  It was the face of a man  and of a man who  having come to a decision  intended  at all costs  to abide by it    No  Christobel   he said   No  my Beloved  I could not accept happiness even such happiness at so great a cost to you  There could be no bliss for you  no peace  no satisfaction  even in our great love  if you had gone against your supreme sense of duty  your own high conception of right and wrong  Also  Christobel  dearest you must not give yourself in a rush of emotion  You must give yourself deliberately where your mind has chosen  and where your great soul is content  That being so  I must be off  Christobel  and don t  you worry about me  You ve  been heavenly good to me  dear  and I ve  put you through so much  I will go up to town to night  I shall not come back  unless you send for me  But when you want me and send why  my Love  I will come from the other end of the world    He stooped and took both her hands in his  lifted them reverently  tenderly  to his lips  held them there one moment  then laid them back upon her lap  and turned away   She saw him walk down the moonlit lawn  tall and erect  She saw him pass through the gate  without looking back  She heard it close quietly not with the old boyish bang yet close irrevocably  decisively   Then she shut her eyes  and began again to rock gently to and fro  Little Boy Blue was still in her arms  it comforted her to rock him there  But the man who had arisen and left her  when he might  taking advantage of her weakness  have won her against her own conscience and will  the man who  mastering his own agony  had thus been brave and strong for her had carried her whole heart with him  when he went out through the postern gate   In rising  he left the Boy in her arms  Through the long hard years to come  she prayed she might keep him there her own Little Boy Blue   But he who went out alone  for her sake to face life without her  was the man she loved   She knew it  at last    And the evening and the morning were the fifth day       THE SIXTH DAY  MISS ANN HAS  MUCH TO SAY   On the afternoon of the sixth day  at the hour which had hitherto been kept for the Boy  Christobel Charteris  in response to another urgent and immediate summons  went to take tea with Miss Ann   It had been a long  dull  uneventful day  holding at first a certain amount of restless uncertainty as to whether the Boy was really gone  mingled with apprehensive anticipation of a call from the Professor   But before noon a reply paid telegram arrived from the Boy  sent off at Charing Cross     Good morning  All s well  Just off for Folkestone  Please tell me how you are     To which  while Jenkins and the telegraph boy waited  Miss Charteris replied     Quite well  thank you  Do be careful at Folkestone     and afterwards thought of many other messages which she might have sent  holding more  and better expressed  But that precious moment in touch with the Boy passed so quickly  and it seemed so impossible to think of anything but commonplace words  while Jenkins stood at attention near the table  and the telegraph boy kept ringing his bicycle bell outside  as a reminder that he waited   Yet her heart felt warmed and comforted by this momentary contact with the Boy  He still cared to know how she was  And it was so like him to put   All s well   He wished her to know he had not gone down beneath his trouble   Fanks  but I always does my own cawwying   Brave Little Boy Blue  of long ago   The expectation of the Professor s note or call remained  keeping her anxious  until she heard from Ann Harvey  that her brother had been obliged to go to London on business  and would not return until the evening   Come to tea with me  dear child   the note concluded   we have much to say    It seemed to Christobel that there remained nothing which Miss Ann had not already said  in every possible form and way  Nevertheless  she put on her hat  and went  Miss Ann had succeeded in impressing all her friends with the conviction that her wishes must never be thwarted   Miss Ann had named her villa  Shiloh   undoubtedly a suitable name  so far as she herself was concerned  her time being mostly spent upon a comfortable sofa in her tiny drawing room  or reclining on a wicker lounge beneath the one tree in her small garden  or being carefully wheeled out in a bath chair   But nobody else found Miss Ann s villa in any sense a  resting place   She had a way of keeping everybody about her from jaded Emma to the most casual caller on the move  while she herself presented a delicate picture of frail inactivity  Immediately upon their arrival  her friends found an appointed task awaiting them  but it was always something which Miss Ann would have given to somebody else to do  had they not chanced at that moment to appear  and they were usually left with the feeling that the particular somebody else whose privilege they  in their well meant zeal  had usurped would have accomplished it better   Directing them from the sofa  Miss Ann kept her entourage busy and perpetually on the move  Yet she never felt she was asking much of them  nor  however weary at the conclusion of the task  did they ever feel much had been accomplished  owing to the judicious use of the word  just     My dear   Miss Ann would say   as you are here  will you just clean the canary   Cleaning the canary meant a very thorough turning out of an intricate little brass cage  several journeys up and down stairs in quest of sand  seed  and brass polish  and an out door excursion to a neighbour s garden for groundsel  The canary s name was  Sweetie weet   and  however much annoyed Miss Ann s friends might be feeling with the canary  they had to call him  Sweetie weet  all the time they  cleaned him   lest his flutterings should upset Miss Ann  Now you cannot say  Sweetie weet  in an angry voice  Try  and you will see  Consequently Miss Ann s friends had no vent for their feelings during the process of getting a rather large hand in and out of a very small brass door with a spring  which always snapped to  at the wrong moment  while the hand  which seemed to its possessor larger than it had ever seemed before  was crooked round in an impossible position in a strained attempt to fix Sweetie weet s perches  If anything went wrong during the cleaning process  Miss Ann  from her vantage ground on the sofa would sigh  and exclaim   Poor patient little Sweetie weet   Miss Ann was in full possession of all her faculties  Her hearing was preternaturally sharp  It was no use saying  Fiend   to Sweetie weet  in an emphatic whisper  He fluttered the more   When the task was completed  the cage had to be brought to Miss Ann s couch for inspection  She then usually discovered the perches to have been put back before they were perfectly dry  Now nothing as surely you hardly ought to require to be told was so prejudicial to Sweetie weet s delicate constitution as to have damp wood beneath his precious little feet  Consequently all the perches had just to be taken out again  dried before the kitchen fire  and put back once more  When this mandate went forth  the glee in the bright black eyes in Sweetie weet s yellow head was unmistakable  He shared Miss Ann s mania for keeping people busy   When  at last  the second installation of perches was over  and the cage was suspended from the brass chain in the sunny window  Sweetie weet poured forth a shrill crescendo of ear piercing sarcasm  a little song of praise  Miss Ann called it directed full at the hot and exhausted friend  who was applying a pocket handkerchief to the wire scratches on the back of her hand  and trying to smile at Miss Ann s recital of all Emma would say  when she found that her special privilege and delight the cleaning of Sweetie weet had been wrested from her by the over zealous friend  As a matter of fact  jaded Emma s personal remarks about Sweetie weet  during the perch drying process in the kitchen  had been of a nature which would not bear repeating in Sweetie weet s presence  and had provided the only amusement the friend had got out of the whole performance   When Christobel Charteris arrived at Shiloh  she found Miss Ann on the green velvet sofa  looking very frail and ethereal  a Shetland shawl about her shoulders  fastened by the largest and most mysterious of her hair brooches a gold mounted oval brooch  in which a weeping willow of fair hair drooped over a sarcophagus of dark hair  while a crescent moon of grey hair kept watch over both  This funereal collection of family hair always possessed a weird fascination for small children  brought by their parents to call upon Miss Ann  The most undemonstrative became affectionate  and hastened with ready docility to the sofa to kiss Miss Ann  in order to obtain a closer view  and to settle the much disputed point as to the significance of a small round object in the left hand corner at the bottom  In fact  to the undisguised dismay of his mother  a sturdy youngster once emerged from Miss Ann s embrace  exclaiming eagerly to his little sister   It s a furze bush  not a hedgehog   An unfortunate remark  which might have been taken by Miss Ann to refer to even more personal matters than a detail in her brooch   Christobel herself was not altogether free from the spell of this hirsute cemetery  chiefly because she knew it was worn on days when deep emotion was to be felt and expressed  At sight of it  she was quite prepared for the tearful smile with which Miss Ann signed to her to close the door  Then extending her arms   Sweet sister   she said  with emotion   let me take you to my heart    It was somewhat startling to Christobel to be apostrophized as  sister  by Miss Ann  The Boy had made her feel so young  and so completely his contemporary  that if Miss Ann had called her  daughter   or even  granddaughter   it would have seemed more appropriate  Also her magnificent proportions constituted a somewhat large order for Miss Ann s proposed embrace   However  she knelt beside the sofa  and allowed herself to be taken to Miss Ann s heart in sections  Then  having found and restored Miss Ann s lace pocket handkerchief  she seated herself in a low chair beside the couch  hoping for enlightenment upon the immediate prospects of her own future   Miss Ann wept gently for a while  Christobel sat silent  Her recent experience of tears  wrung from such deep anguish of soul  made it less easy for her to feel sympathetic towards tears which flowed from no apparent cause  and fell delicately into perfumed lace  So she waited in silence  while Miss Ann wept   The room was very still  The bang with which the Boy usually made his entry anywhere  would have been terrific in its joyful suddenness  At the mere thought of it  Christobel s heart stood still and listened  But this was a place into which the Boy would never make an entry  noisy or otherwise  Besides the Boy was gone  Oh  silent  sober  sorry world  The Boy was gone   Sweetie weet put his head on one side  and chirped interrogatively  In his judgment  the silence had lasted sufficiently long   Miss Ann dried her eyes  making an effort to control her emotion  Then she spoke  in a voice which still trembled    Dearest child   she said   I want you just to cover this book for me  Emma has offered to do it  several times  but I said   No  Emma  We must keep it for Miss Christobel  I do not know what she would say to you  if you took to covering my books   Emma is a good soul  and willing  but has not the mind and method required to cover a book properly  If you will just run up to my room  dear child  you will find a neat piece of whity brown paper laid aside on purpose     Hush  Sweetie weet  Christobel knows you are pleased to see her     It is either on the ottoman behind the screen  or in the top left hand drawer of the mahogany chest  between the window and the fireplace  Ah  how much we have come through  during the last twenty four hours  The scissors  dear Love  are hanging by black tape from a nail in the store room  You require a large and common pair for cutting brown paper  How truly wonderful are the ways of Providence  dear Christobel  The paste is in the little cupboard under the stairs    When Miss Charteris had finished covering the book  having bent upon it all the mind and method it required  she forestalled the setting of another task  by saying firmly   I want an important talk now  please  Ann  are you sure you told your brother that I had cared for him for years     Darling  dear Kenrick was so diffident  so unable to realize his own powers of attraction  so     Do you think it was fair toward a woman  even if it were true  to tell a man who had never asked her love  that that love has long been his     Sweet child  how crudely you put it  I merely hinted  whispered  gave the most delicate indications of what I knew to be your feeling  For you do love my brother  do you not  dear Christobel     I think   said Miss Charteris  slowly  weighing each word   I think I love the Professor as a woman loves a book    There was a moment of tense silence in Miss Ann s drawing room  Christobel Charteris looked straight before her  a stern light upon her face  as of one confronted on the path of duty by the clear shining of the mirror of self revelation   Into Miss Ann s pale blue eyes shot a gleam of nervous anxiety   Sweetie weet chirped  interrogatively   Then Miss Ann  recovering  clasped her hands   Ah  what a beautiful definition   she said   What could be more pure  more perfect    Miss Charteris knew a love of a very different kind  which was absolutely pure  and altogether perfect  But that was the love she had put from her    A woman could hardly marry a book   she said   Miss Ann gave a little deprecatory shriek   Darling child   she cried   No simile  however beautiful  should be pressed too far  Your exquisite description of your love for dear Kenrick merely assures us that your union with him will prove one of complete contentment to the mind  And the mind that sensitive instrument  attuned to all the immensities of the intellectual spheres the mind is what really matters     Bodies count   said Miss Charteris  with conviction  adding beneath her breath  the dawning of a smile in her sad eyes   We shall jolly well find  bodies count    Miss Ann s hearing  as we have already remarked  was preternaturally sharp  She started   My dear Christobel  what an expression  And do you not think  that  under these circumstances  any mention of bodies savours of impropriety    Miss Charteris turned quickly  The colour flamed into her beautiful face  The glint of angry indignation flashed from her eyes  But the elderly figure on the couch looked so small and frail  To wound and crush it would be so easy  and so unworthy of her strength  and wider experience   Suddenly she remembered a little blue back  round with grief and shame  a small sandy face  silent and unflinching  a brave little heart which kept its faith in God  and prayed on trustfully  while nurses misunderstood and bullied  Then Miss Charteris conquered her own wrath    Dear Ann   she said  gently   do you really believe your brother would be much disappointed if after all when he asks me to marry him which he has not done yet I feel it better not to do so     My darling child   exclaimed Miss Ann  and her hair brooch flew open  as if to accentuate her horror and amazement   My darling child  Think how patiently he has waited  Remember the long years  Remember     Yes  I know   said Miss Charteris   You told me all that last night  didn t  you  But it seems to me that  if a man can wait twelve years  he might as well wait twenty     So he would have   cried Miss Ann   Undoubtedly dear Kenrick would have waited twenty years  had it not been for this fortunate legacy  which places him in a position to marry at once  But why should you wish to keep him waiting any longer  Is not twelve years sufficiently long    Miss Charteris smiled   Twelve days would be too long for some people   she said  gently   I have no wish to keep him waiting  But you must remember  Ann  the Professor has  as yet  spoken no word of love to me     Dear child   said Miss Ann  eagerly   he would have come to you to day  but imperative legal business  connected with our uncle s will  took him to town  I know for certain that he intends writing to you this evening  and  if you then give him leave to do so  he will call upon you to morrow  Oh  darling girl  you will not disappoint us  We have so trusted you  so believed in you  A less scrupulously honourable man than Kenrick  might have tried to bind you by a promise  before he was in a position to offer you immediate marriage  Think of all the hopes the hopes and p plans  which depend upon your faithfulness   Miss Ann dissolved into tears but not to a degree which should hinder her flow of eloquence   Ah  sweetest child  You knelt beside this very sofa  five years ago  and you said   Ann  I think any woman might be proud to become the wife of the Professor   Have you forgotten that you said that  kneeling beside this very sofa     I have not forgotten   said Miss Charteris   and I think so still     Then you will marry Kenrick   said Miss Ann  through her tears   Christobel Charteris rose  She stood  for a moment  tall and immovable  in the small  low room  crowded with knick knacks china  bric a brac  ferns in painted pots  embroidery  photograph frames overseated with easy chairs  which  in their turn  were overfilled with a varied assortment of cushions  Miss Ann s drawing room gave the effect of a rather prettily arranged bazaar  You mentally pictured yourself walking round  admiring everything  but seeing nothing you liked quite well enough to wish to buy it  and take it home   Christobel Charteris  tall and stately  in her simple white gown  looked so utterly apart from the trumpery elegance of these surroundings  As the Boy had said  the mellow beauty of his ancestral homes would indeed be a fit setting for her stately grace  But she had sent away the Boy  with his beautiful castles in the air  and places in the shires  The atmosphere and surroundings of Shiloh were those to which she must be willing to bend her fastidious taste  Miss Ann would expect to make her home with the Professor    Then you will marry Kenrick   whispered Miss Ann  through her lace pocket handkerchief   Christobel bent over her  tenderly  fastening the clasp of the mysterious hair brooch    Dear Ann   she said   It will not be leap year again  until       And  meanwhile  the Professor has not proposed marriage to me    Miss Ann instantly brightened  Laughing gaily  she wiped away a few remaining tears    Ah  naughty   she said   Naughty  to make me tell  But as you will ask he is going to write to night  But you must never let him know I told you  And now I want you just to find the Spectator it is laid over that exquisitely embroidered blotter on the writing table in the window  sent me last Christmas by that kind creature  Lady Goldsmith  so thoughtful  tasteful  and quite touching  Emma  careful soul  spread it over the blotter  while darling Sweetie weetie took his bath  Dear pet  it is a sight to see him splash and splutter  Lady Goldsmith thinks so much of dear Kenrick  The first time she saw him  she was immensely struck by his extraordinarily clever appearance  He sat exactly opposite her at a Guildhall banquet  and she told me afterwards that the mere sight of him was sufficient to take away all inclination for food  excepting for that intellectual nourishment which he is so well able to supply  I thought that was rather well expressed  and  coming from a florid woman  such as Lady Goldsmith  was quite a tribute to my brother  You would call Lady Goldsmith  florid   would you not  dear Christobel      Oh  you do not know her by sight  I am surprised  As the wife of the Professor  you will soon know all these distinguished people by sight  Yes  she is undoubtedly florid  and inclined to be what my dear father used to call  a woman of a stout habit   This being the case  it was certainly a tribute a tribute of which you and I  dearest child  have a right to feel justly proud     Oh  is it still damp  Naughty Sweetie weet  Don t  you think it might be wise  just to take it to the kitchen  Emma  good soul  will let you dry it before the fire  I have heard of fatalities caused by damp newspapers  Precious child  we can have you run no risks  What would Kenrick say  But when it is absolutely dry  I want you just to explain to me the gist of that article on the effect of oriental literature on modern thought  Kenrick tells me you have read it  He wishes to discuss it with me  I really cannot undertake to read it through  I have not the time required  Yet I must be prepared to talk it over intelligently with my brother  when next he pays me a visit  He may look in this evening  weary with his day in town  and requiring the relaxation of a little intellectual conversation  I must be ready    An hour later  somewhat tired in body  and completely exhausted in mind  Miss Charteris walked home  She made a detour  in order to pass along the lane  and enter through the postern gate at the bottom of the garden   She opened it  and passed in   A shaft of sunlight lay along the lawn  The jolly little  what d  you call  ems  lifted gay purple faces to the sky   She paused in the doorway  trying to realize how this quiet green seclusion  the old fashioned flower borders  the spreading mulberry tree  the quaint white house  in the distance  with its green shutters  must have looked to the Boy each day  as he came in  She knew he had more eye for colour  and more knowledge of artistic effect  than his casual acquaintances might suppose  It would not surprise her some day to find  as one of the gems of the New Gallery  a reproduction of her own garden  with a halo of jolly little  what d  you call  ems  in the borders  and an indication of seats  deep in the shadow of the mulberry tree  She would not need to refer to the catalogue for the artist s name  The Boy had had a painting in the Academy the year before  She had chanced to see it  Noticing the name of her Little Boy Blue of the Dovercourt sands in the catalogue  she had made her way through the crowded rooms  and found his picture  It hung on the line  She had been struck by its thoughtful beauty  and wealth of imaginative skill  She had not forgotten that picture  and during all these days she had been quietly waiting to hear the Boy say he had had a painting in the Academy  Then she was going to tell him she had seen it  had greatly admired it  and had noted with pleasure all the kind things critics had said of it   But  the subject of pictures not having come up  it had not occurred to the Boy to mention it  The Boy never talked of what he had done  because he had done it  But were a subject mentioned upon which he was keen  he would bound up  with shining eyes  and tell you all he knew about it  all he had seen  heard  and done  all he was doing  and all he hoped to do in the future  in connexion with that particular thing  He would never have thought of informing you that he owned three aeroplanes  But if the subject of aviation came up  and you said to the Boy   Do you know anything about it   he would lean forward  beaming at you  and say   I should jolly well think I do   and talk aeroplanes to you for as long as you were willing to listen  This trait of the Boy s  caused shallow minded people to consider him conceited  But the woman he loved knew how to distinguish between keenness and conceit  between exuberant enthusiasm and egotistical self assertion  and the woman who loved him  smiled tenderly as she remembered that even on the day when she scolded him  and he had to admit his  barely respectable B A    he had not told her of the painting hung on the line and mentioned in the Times  Yet if the question of art had come up  the Boy would very probably have sat forward in his chair  and talked about his painting  straight on end  for half an hour   She still stood beneath the archway  in the red brick wall  as these thoughts chased quickly through her mind  She would have made a fair picture for any one who had chanced to be waiting beneath the mulberry tree  with eyes upon the gate    Straight on end for half an hour  he would have talked about his picture  and how bright his eyes would have been  And then I should have said   I saw it  Boy dear  and it was quite as beautiful as you say   And he would have answered   It jolly well gave you the feeling of the scene  didn t  it  Christobel   And I should have known that his delight in it  as an artistic success  had nothing to do with the fact that it was painted by himself  Just because egotism is impossible to him  he is free to be so full of vivid enthusiasm    She smiled again  A warm glow seemed to enfold her   How well I know my Boy   she said aloud  then remembered with a sudden pang that she must not call him her Boy  She had let him go  She was very probably going to marry the Professor  She had not with the whole of her being wanted him to stay  until he had had the manliness to rise up and go  Then it had been too late  Ah  was it too late  If the Boy came back to plead once more  If once again she could hear him say   Age is nothing  Time is nothing  Love is all   would she not answer   Yes  Guy  Love is all    The blood rushed into her sweet proud face  The name of the man she loved had come into her mind unconsciously  It had never yet as a name for him passed her lips  That she should unconsciously call him so in her heart  gave her another swift moment of self revelation   She closed the gate gently  careful not to let it bang  As she passed up the lawn  her heart stood still  It seemed to her that he must be waiting  in the shade of the mulberry tree   She hardly dared to look  She felt so sure he was there     Yes  she knew he was there     She felt certain the Boy had come back  He could not stay away from her on his sixth day  Had he not said he would  march round  every day  Ah  dear waiting army of Israel  Here was Jericho hastening to meet it  Why had she allowed Ann Harvey to keep her so late  Why had she gone at all  during the Boy s own time  She might have known he would come     Should she walk past the mulberry  as if making for the house  just for the joy of hearing him call  Christobel   No  that would not be quite honest  knowing he was there  and they were always absolutely honest with one another   She passed  breathlessly  under the drooping branches  Her cheeks glowed  her lips were parted  Her eyes shone with love and expectation   She lifted a hanging bough  and passed beneath   His chair was there  and hers  but they were empty  The Boy being the Boy had not come back   Presently she went slowly up to the house   A telegram lay on the hall table  She knew at once from whom it came  There was but one person who carried on a correspondence by telegraph  Reply paid was written on the envelope   She stood quite still for a moment  Then she opened it slowly  Telegrams from the Boy gave her a delicious memory of the way he used to jump about  He would be out of his chair  and sitting at her feet  before she knew he was going to move   She opened it slowly  turned to a window  and read it     How are you  dear  Please tell me  I am going to do my big fly to morrow  I jolly well mean to break the record  Wish me luck     She took up the reply paid form and wrote     Quite well  Good luck  but please be careful  Little Boy Blue     She hesitated a moment  before writing the playful name by which she so often called him  But his telegram was so absolutely the Boy  all over  It was best he should know nothing of  the man she loved   who had gone out at the gate  It was best he should not know what she would have called him  had he been under the mulberry just now  She was undoubtedly going to marry the Professor  In which case she would never call the Boy anything but  Little Boy Blue   So she put it into her telegram  as a repartee to his audacious  dear   Then she went out  and sent it off herself  It was comforting to have something  however small  to do for him   She came in again  dressed for the evening  and dined  She was thoroughly tired  and one sentence beat itself incessantly against the mirror of her reflection  like a frightened bird with a broken wing   He is going to do a big fly to morrow     He is going to do a big fly to morrow  Little Boy Blue is going to fly and break the record    She sat in the stillness of her drawing room  and tried to read  But between her eyes and the printed page  burned in letters of fire   He is going to fly to morrow    She went down the garden to the chairs beneath the mulberry tree  It was cooler there  but the loneliness was too fierce an agony   She walked up and down the lawn  now bathed in silvery moonlight   He is going to do a big fly to morrow  He jolly well means to break the record    She passed in  and went to her bedroom  She lay in the darkness and tried to sleep  She tried in vain  What if he got into cross currents  What if the propeller broke  What if the steering gear twisted  She began remembering every detail he had told herself and Mollie  when she sat listening  thinking of him as Mollie s lover  though all the while he had been her Little Boy Blue      Oh of course then it is all U P  But there must be pioneers    At last she could bear it no longer  She lighted her candle  and rose  She went to her medicine cupboard  and did a thing she had never done before  in the whole of her healthy life  She took a sleeping draught  The draught was one of Miss Ann s  left behind at the close of a recent visit  She knew it contained chiefly bromide  harmless but effective   She put out the light  and lay once more in darkness   The bromide began to act   The bird with the broken wing became less insistent   The absent Boy drew near  and bent over  kneeling beside her   She talked to him softly  Her voice sounded far away  and unlike her own   Be careful  Little Boy Blue   she said   You may jolly well what an expression  break the record if you like  but don t  break yourself  because  if you do  you will break my heart    The bromide was acting strongly now  The bird with the broken wing had gone  There was a strange rhythmical throbbing in her ears  It was the Boy s aeroplane  but it had started without him  She knew sleep was coming  merciful oblivion  Yet now she was too happy to wish to sleep   The Boy drew nearer    Oh  Boy dear  I love you so   she whispered into the throbbing darkness   I love you so     I know you do  dear   said the Boy   It is almost unbelievable  Christobel  but I know you do    Then she put up her arms  and drew him to her breast   Thus the Boy though far away marched round    And the evening and the morning were the sixth day       AN INTERLUDE   AS A DREAM  WHEN ONE AWAKETH   When Miss Charteris opened her eyes  the sun was streaming into her room  The sense of having slept heavily and unnaturally lay upon her  She had not heard Martha s entry  but her blinds were up  and the tea on the tray beside her bed was still fresh and hot   She took a cup  and the after effects of the bromide seemed to leave her   She dressed  and went downstairs   On the breakfast table  beside her plate  lay the Professor s letter  When she had poured out her coffee and buttered her toast  she opened and read it   The letter was exactly such as she had always dreamed the Professor would write  if he ever came to the point of making her a proposal  He touched on their long friendship  on how much it had meant to them both  He said he had often hoped for the possibility of a closer tie  but had not felt justified in suggesting it  until he was in a position to offer her a suitable home and income  This was now fortunately the case  therefore he hastened to write and plead his cause  though keenly conscious of how little there was in himself calculated to call forth in a woman the affection which it was his earnest hope and desire to win  She had trusted him as a friend  an intellectual guide and comrade  during many years  If she could now bring herself to trust him in a yet more intimate relation  he would endeavour never to disappoint or fail her   The letter was signed    Yours in sincere devotion    KENRICK HARVEY    A postscript requested to be allowed to call  at the usual hour  that afternoon  for a reply   Miss Charteris wrote a brief note of thanks and appreciation  and gave the Professor leave to call at three   The Professor called at three   He knocked and rang  and fumbled long over the umbrella stand in the hall  He seemed to be taking all the umbrellas out  and putting them back again   At last he appeared at the door of the drawing room  where Miss Charteris awaited him  He was very nervous  He repeated the substance of his letter  only rather less well expressed  He alluded to Miss Ann  and to the extreme happiness and pleasure to her of having Christobel as a sister  But he completely ignored  both in the letter and in conversation  Miss Ann s betrayal of Christobel s confidence  For this she was grateful to him   As soon as the Professor  having floundered through the unusual waters of expressed sentiment  stepped out on to the high and dry path of an actual question  Miss Charteris answered that question in the affirmative  and accepted the Professor s offer   He rose  and held her hand for a few moments  looking at her with great affection through his glasses  which did not at all impede the warmth of his regard  in fact  being powerful convex lenses  they magnified it  Then he kissed her rather awkwardly on the brow  and hurried back to his seat   A somewhat strained silence would have followed  had not the Professor had an inspiration   Drawing a book from his pocket  he looked at her as you look at a child for whom you have a delightful surprise in store    That er matter being satisfactorily settled  my dear Christobel   he said   should we not find it decidedly er refreshing to spend an hour over our Persian translation    Miss Charteris agreed at once  but while the Professor read  translated  and expounded  expatiating on the interest and beauty of various passages  her mind wandered   She found herself picturing the Boy under similar circumstances  how the Boy would have behaved during the first hour of engagement  what the Boy would have said  what the Boy would have done  She was not quite sure what the Boy would have done  she had never experienced the Boy with the curb completely off  But she suddenly remembered   Millions  or would it be billions   and the recollection gave her a shock of such vivid reaction  that she laughed aloud   The Professor paused  and looked up in surprise  Then he smiled  indulgently    My dear er Christobel  this passage is not intended to be humorous   he said    I know it is not   replied Miss Charteris   I beg your pardon  I laughed involuntarily    The Professor resumed his reading   No  she was not quite sure as to all the Boy would have done  but she knew quite well what he would have said   And here the Boy  quite unexpectedly  took a First in classics  for what the Boy would have said would certainly have been Greek to the Professor   After this  events followed one another so rapidly that the whole thing became dream like to Miss Charteris  She found herself helpless in the grip of Miss Ann s iron will up to now  carefully shrouded in Shetland and lace  At last she understood why Emma s old mother had had to die alone in a little cottage away in Northumberland  Emma  good soul  being too devoted to her mistress to ask for the necessary week  in order to go home and nurse her mother  Emma had seemed a broken woman  ever since  and Christobel understood now the impossibility of any one ever asking Miss Ann for a thing which Miss Ann had made up her mind not to grant   She and the Professor now became puppets in Miss Ann s delicate hands  Miss Ann lay upon her couch  and pulled the wires  The Professor danced  because he had not the discernment to know he was dancing  Miss Charteris  because she had not the heart to resist  The Boy having gone out of her life  nothing seemed to matter  It was her duty to marry the Professor  and there is nothing to be gained by the postponement of duty   But it was Miss Ann who insisted on the wedding taking place within a week  It was Miss Ann who reminded them that  the Long Vacation having just commenced  the Professor could easily be away  and there were researches connected with his Encyclopedia which it was of the utmost importance he should immediately make in the museums and libraries of Brussels  It was Miss Ann who insisted upon a special licence being obtained  and who overruled Christobel s desire to be married by her brother  the bishop  Miss Ann had become quite hysterical at the idea of the bishop being brought back from a tour he was making in Ireland  and Christobel yielded the more readily  because her brother s arrival would undoubtedly have meant Mollie s  and Mollie s presence  even if she refrained from protest and expostulation  would have brought such poignant memories of the Boy   So it came to pass  with a queer sense of the whole thing being dream like and unreal  that Miss Charteris who should have had the most crowded and most popular wedding in Cambridge found herself standing  as a bride  beside the Professor  in an ill ventilated church  at ten o clock in the morning  being married by an old clergyman she had never seen before  who seemed partially deaf  and partially blind  and wholly inadequate to the solemn occasion  with Miss Ann and her faithful Emma  sniffing in a pew on one side  while Jenkins breathed rather heavily in a pew  on the other  Martha had flatly refused to attend  and when Miss Charteris sent for her to bid her good bye  Martha had appeared  apparently in her worst and most morose temper  then had suddenly broken down  and  exclaiming wildly    Ow about  im   had thrown her apron over her head  and left the room  sobbing    How about him  How about him    Each turn of the wheels reiterated the question as she drove to Shiloh to pick up Miss Ann  then on to the church where the Professor waited   How about him  But he had left her to do that which she felt to be right  and she was doing it   Nevertheless  Martha s wild outburst had brought the Boy very near  and he seemed with her as she walked up the church   Her mind wandered during the reading of the exhortation  In this nightmare of a wedding she seemed to have no really important part to play  The Boy would burst in  in a minute  and a shaft of light would come with him  He would walk straight up the church to her  saying   We have jolly well had enough of this  Christobel   Then they would all wake up  and he would whirl her away in a motor and she would say   Boy dear  don t  exceed the speed limit    But the Boy did not burst in  and the Professor s hands  looking unusually large in a pair of white kid gloves  were twitching nervously  for an emphatic question was being put to him by the old clergyman  who had emerged from his hiding place behind the Prayer book  as soon as the exhortation was over   The Professor said   I will   with considerable emotion  while Miss Ann sobbed audibly into her lace pocket handkerchief   Christobel looked at the Professor  His outward appearance seemed greatly improved  His beard had been trimmed  his hair what there was of it cut  He had not once looked at her since she entered the church and took her place at his side  but she knew  if he did look  his eyes would be kind kind  with a magnified kindness  behind the convex lenses  The Boy had asked whether she loved the Professor s mouth  eyes  and hair  What questions the amazing Boy used to ask  And she had answered   But here a silence in the church recalled her wandering thoughts  The all important question had been put to her  She had not heard one word of it  yet the church awaited her  I will    The silence became alarming  This was the exact psychological moment in which the Boy should have dashed in to the rescue  But the Boy did not dash in   Then Christobel Charteris did a thing perhaps unique in the annals of brides  but essentially characteristic of her extreme honesty    I am sorry   she said  in a low voice   I did not hear the question  Will you be good enough to repeat it    Miss Ann  in the pew behind  gasped audibly  The old clergyman peered at her  in astonishment  over his glasses  His eyes were red rimmed and bloodshot   Then he repeated the question slowly and deliberately  introducing a tone of reproof  which made of it a menace  Miss Charteris listened carefully to each clause and at the end she said   I will    Whereupon  with much fumbling  the Professor and the old clergyman between them  succeeded in finding a ring  and in placing it upon the third finger of her left hand  As they did so  her thoughts wandered again  She was back in the garden with the Boy  He had caught her left hand in both his  and kissed it  then  dividing the third finger from the others  and holding it apart with his strong brown ones  he had laid his lips upon it  with a touch of unspeakable reverence and tenderness  She understood now  why the Boy had kissed that finger separately  She looked down at it  The Professor s ring encircled it   Then the old clergyman said   Let us pray   and  kneeling meekly upon her knees  Christobel Charteris prayed  with all her heart  that she might be a good wife to her old friend  the Professor   From the church  they drove straight to the station  Miss Ann s plan for them being  that they should lunch in London  reach Folkestone in time for tea  and spend a day or two there  at a boarding house kept by an old cronie of Miss Ann s  before crossing to Boulogne  en route for Brussels   Christobel disliked the idea of the boarding house  extremely  She had never  in her life  stayed at a boarding house  moreover it seemed to her that a wedding journey called imperatively for hotels and the best of hotels  But Miss Ann had dismissed the question with an authoritative wave of the hand  and a veiled insinuation that hotels particularly Metropole hotels were scarcely proper places  Dear Miss Slinker s boarding house would be so safe and nice  and the company so congenial  But here the Professor had interposed  laying his hand gently on Christobel s   My dear Ann  we take our congenial company with us    This was the farthest excursion into the realm of sentiment  upon which the Professor had as yet ventured  The sober  middle aged side of Miss Charteris had appreciated it  with a certain amount of grateful emotion  But the youthful soul of Christobel had suddenly realized how the Boy would slap his leg  and rock  over the recital of such a sentence  and  between the two  she had been reduced to a condition bordering on hysterics   They travelled from Cambridge in a first class compartment  had it to themselves  and fell quite naturally into the style of conversation which had always characterized their friendship  meeting each other s minds  not over the happenings of a living present  but in a mutual appreciation of the great intellects of a dead and gone past  Before long  the Professor had whisked his favourite Persian poet from the tail pocket of his coat  Christobel had provided paper and pencil  and they were deep in translation   Arrived at Liverpool Street station  they entered a four wheeler  and trundled slowly off to Cannon Street  Christobel had imagined four wheelers to be obsolete  but the Professor dismissed her suggestion of a taxi  as being  a needlessly rapid mode of progression  indubitably fraught with perpetual danger   and proceeded to hail the sleepy and astonished driver of a four wheeled cab    Oh  Boy dear  what would you have said to that four wheeler you dear record breaking  speed limit exceeding  astonishingly rapid Boy  That ancient four wheeler  trundling past the Bank of England  the Royal Exchange  the Mansion House  up King William Street  and round into Cannon Street  endlessly blocked  continually pulling up  then starting on  only to be stopped again  and your Beloved inside it  Boy dear  looking out of the ramshackle old window  in a vain endeavour to see something of the London you had planned to show her in your own delightful extravagant way  Oh  Boy dear  keep out of this  It is not your show  This four wheeler has been hailed and engaged by the Professor  The lady within is the bride of the Professor  Hands off  Boy    They drew up  for a few minutes  outside a bookseller s in New Broad Street  on the left hand side  just after they had trundled into it a delightful little place  crammed  lined  almost carpeted  with books  The Professor plunged in  upsetting a pile of magazines in his hasty entrance through the narrow doorway  Here he always found precisely the book he happened to be requiring for his latest research  With an incoherent remark to the proprietor  who advanced to meet him  the Professor became immediately absorbed  in a far corner of the shop  oblivious of his cab  his bride  and his train  Christobel had followed him  and stood  a dignified  but somewhat lonely figure  just within the doorway  She had been to this shop with her father  during his lifetime  on several occasions  and had since often written for books  The bookseller came forward  He was a man possessed of the useful faculty of remembering faces and the names appertaining to them  Also he had cultivated the habit of taking an intelligent interest in his customers  But he did not connect this beautiful waiting figure  with the absorbed back of the Professor    What can I do for you to day  Miss Charteris   he inquired  with ready courtesy   Christobel started   Nothing to day  thank you  Mr  Taylor  But I am much obliged to you for so often supplying my requirements by return of post  And  by the way  you have an excellent memory  It is many years since I came here last  with my father     Professor Charteris was one of my best customers   said the bookseller  in an undertone of deferential sympathy   I never knew a finer judge of a book than he  If I may be allowed to say so  I deeply deplored his loss  Miss Charteris    Christobel smiled  and gently unbent  allowing the kindly expression of appreciation and regret to reach her with comfort in these moments of dream like isolation  A friendly hand seemed to have been outstretched across the chasm which divides the passionately regretted past  from the scarcely appreciated present  She could see her father s tall scholarly figure  as he stood lovingly fingering a book  engaged in earnest conversation with Mr  Taylor  regardless of the passing of time  until she was obliged to lay her hand on his arm  and hurry him through the crowded streets  down the steep incline  to the platform from which the Cambridge express was on the point of starting  And when safely seated  with barely a minute to spare  he would turn to her  with a smile of gentle reproof  saying   But  my dear child  we had not concluded our conversation   And she would laugh and say   But we had to get home to night  Papa   Whereupon he would lean back  contentedly  replying   Quite right  my dear  So we had    Ah  happy those whose fathers and mothers still walk the earth beside them  Youth remains  notwithstanding the passing of years  while there is still a voice to say  in reproof or approbation   My child    But the bookseller  not yet connecting her with the Professor  still waited her pleasure  and suddenly a thought struck Christobel  An eager wish awoke within her    Mr  Taylor   she said  hurriedly   can you supply me with the very newest thing on the subject of aviation  I want to learn all there is to know about propellers  steering gear  cross currents  and how to avoid the dangers    She stopped short  The Professor had found what he wanted  and was fumbling for his purse   The bookseller turned quickly to a pile at his elbow  took up a paper covered book  and placed it in her hands   The very latest   he said   Published yesterday  You will find in it all you want to know   Then  as he handed the Professor his change   Allow me to place it to your account  Miss Charteris   he said   Experiencing a quite unaccountable sense of elation and fresh interest in life  Christobel  armed with her book on aviation  re entered the four wheeler  The Professor  absorbed in his own purchase  had not noticed her private transaction  He followed her into the cab  and made three ineffectual attempts to close the door  Just as the driver was slowly beginning to prepare to climb down  Mr  Taylor came across the crowded pavement  to their rescue  released the Professor s coat tail  shut them in  and signed to the cabman to drive on  With a good deal of  gee up  and whip flourishing  they re commenced to trundle  Mr  Taylor was not merely a provider of literature  he was also a keen observer of life  and of human nature  As Christobel leaned forward to acknowledge his help  and to smile her farewell  his expression seemed to say   A four wheeler  Professor Harvey  and the latest work on aviation  An unusual combination    Very unusual   she said to herself  and smiled again  Then it seemed to her that her friend of the bookshop had said   You will find what you want  on page       She knew he had not  as a matter of fact  mentioned any page  but the figures came into her mind  She opened the book  and glanced at page      It was headed   Fine performances by Mr  Guy Chelsea   She shut it quickly  There was no room for the actual presence of the Boy in the Professor s four wheeler   They lunched at a dep t of the Aerated Bread Company  close to Cannon Street station  While Christobel was struggling with a very large plateful of cold tongue  she suddenly remembered that one of the Boy s many plans had been to take her to lunch at his favourite restaurant in Piccadilly  where she would be able to order any dish she fancied  and find it better served than she had ever known it before  or to dine at the Hotel Metropole  where Monsieur Delma s perfect orchestra would play for her any mortal thing for which she chose to ask  and play it better than she had ever heard it played   These memories  and a really excellent cup of coffee  helped Christobel in her struggles with the round of cold tongue  and she looked across the little marble topped table brightly at the Professor  and spoke with a cheerful hopefulness which surprised herself   But something  other than his own plate of cold tongue  seemed weighing on the Professor  He had become preoccupied and distrait   When they reached the Folkestone train  Christobel found out the cause of his preoccupation    My dear Ann I should say Christobel   remarked the Professor  hurriedly  as he put her into an empty compartment  and hesitated in the doorway   I am always accustomed at this hour to have my pipe and a nap  Should you object  my dear Ann er that is  Christobel  if I sought a smoking compartment     Oh  please do   she exclaimed  eagerly  The idea of two hours of freedom and solitude suddenly seemed an undreamed of joy   Don t  think of me  I am quite happy here     I will provide you with a paper   said the Professor  and hailed a passing boy  He laid the paper on her lap  and disappeared   The train started   Christobel looked out of the window as they slowly steamed across the bridge over the Thames  She loved the flow of the river  with its constant procession of barges  dredges  boats  and steamers  a silent  moving highway  right through the heart of the noisy whirl of London street traffic  They ran past old St  Saviour s Church  now promoted to be Southwark Cathedral  out through the suburbs  until streets became villas  woods and meadows appeared  and the train ran through Chislehurst peaceful English resting place where lie entombed the bright Imperial hopes of France then on through Sevenoaks  into the bowery green of the Kentish hop gardens   After passing Sevenoaks  she took up the Professor s paper and glanced at it  Somehow she had felt sure it would be the Daily Graphic  It was the Daily Mirror  She had never held a halfpenny illustrated paper in her hands before  No doubt it was an excellent paper  and met the need of an immense number of people  to whom an additional halfpenny a day would be a consideration  But  that the Professor  when providing her with one paper  should have chosen a halfpenny instead of a penny paper  seemed to hold a curious significance  and called up sudden swift memories of the Boy  He would have bought Punch  the Graphic  the Illustrated  the Spectator  and a Morning Post  plumped them all down on the seat in front of her  then sat beside her  and talked  the whole journey through  so that she would not have had a moment in which to open one of them    Oh  Boy dear  Don t  look at this Daily Mirror  You might misjudge the good Professor  With your fifty thousand a year  how can you be expected to understand a mind which must consider ha pence  even when brides and wedding journeys are concerned  Do keep away  Boy dear  This is not your wedding journey    Then she opened the Daily Mirror  and there looked out at her  from its central page  the merry  handsome  daring face of her own Little Boy Blue   He was seated in his flying machine  steering wheel in hand  looking out from among many wires  His cap was on the back of his head  his bright eyes looked straight into hers  his firm lips  parted in a smile  seemed to be saying   I jolly well mean to do it   Beneath was an account of him  and a description of the flight he was to attempt on that day  across the Channel  circling round Boulogne Cathedral  and back  He was to start at two o clock  At that very moment he must be in mid air   Oh  Little Boy Blue  Little Boy Blue  You have a way of making hearts stand still   The boarding house proved to be a place decidedly conducive to the taking of a fresh air cure  because nobody remained within its four walls  if the weather could possibly admit of their going out   As soon as Christobel and the Professor had taken tea  and replied to Miss Slinker s many questions  they went out to walk on the Leas until sunset  It was a radiant afternoon  and the strong wind which had suddenly arisen  blowing  in unexpected gusts  from the sea  acted as a tonic to weary heart and brain  Christobel  holding on her hat as she walked  battled her way beside the Professor  up a cross street  into the Sandgate Road   There they went to the telegraph office  and sent Miss Ann news of their safe arrival  and of the extreme comfort they felt sure of experiencing at Miss Slinker s delightful abode   This was the Professor s wording    They looked in at Parson s Library just to order a book Miss Ann wanted  and  on a little farther  just to match some crewel silks for a tea cosy Miss Ann was making   These commissions duly executed  they were free to make their way to the Leas parade  whence they would look down upon the beach  and enjoy a distance view across the Channel  They took the side street which brought them out upon the esplanade  close to the lift by which people continuously mounted or descended the steep face of the cliff   A considerable crowd lined the esplanade railing  looking over eagerly  Apparently there was some object of particular interest to be seen below   Christobel and the Professor advanced to the railing  and also looked over   She saw a strange thing floating in the sea  between the promenade pier and the harbour  It seemed a huge insect  with broken wings  Its body was a mass of twisted wires  Around this  a little fleet of rowing boats had gathered  They looked black  on the blue wind swept waters  like water boatmen on a village pond  They darted in and out and round about the wreckage of the huge wings and twisted wire  and seemed waiting for a chance to help   A man stood next to Christobel and the Professor  a man who talked to himself    Ah  poor chap   he said   poor chap  So nearly back  So nearly broke the record  Such a sport     What is that thing in the water   inquired the Professor   The man turned and looked at him    An aeroplane   he said  slowly  speaking with a sort of stolid deliberation   A wrecked aeroplane  Caught in a cross current  worse luck  Just accomplished one of the finest flights on record  Started from up here  skimmed over the Channel to Boulogne  circled round the cathedral such a clear day  we could watch the whole flight with field glasses came gaily back without a stop  was making for the cliff again  when a cross current caught him  something went wrong with the steering gear  and down it goes  with a plunge  head first into the sea     And the er occupant   inquired the Professor    The aeronaut  Ah  he didn t  fall clear  worse luck  or they could soon have fished him out  He stuck to his seat and his wheel  and fell smash in among his wires  They are trying to extricate him now  Bad luck  poor chap  Such a sport     Do you know his name   asked the Professor  peering down at the waiting crowd which lined the beach    Guy Chelsea   said the man   And I give you my word  he was the finest  pluckiest young amateur we had among the airmen    Then Christobel s heart began to beat again  and her limbs seemed to regain the power to move    He is mine   she said   I must go to him  He is my own Little Boy Blue   And she began to run along the Leas toward the stone steps which zigzag down to the shore   She heard the Professor running after her    Ann   he called   Ann  Stay  This is most unnecessary    She flew on    At least take the lift   bawled the Professor   She hurried on and reached the steps  pausing an instant to glance back   The Professor had stopped at the lift  and was waving to her with his umbrella   She could never remember running down those steps  In what seemed but a moment from the time she reached them  she found herself stumbling painfully down the steep slope of shingle to the water s edge   The lift  bearing the Professor  had just begun to crawl down the face of the cliff  She could see him gesticulating through the glass windows   The crowd on the shore  chiefly composed of rough men  was thickest round the base of a wide stone breakwater  jutting out into the sea  On this break water stood an empty stretcher  A coast guardsman marched up and down  keeping the crowd off the breakwater   Christobel reached the outskirts of the crowd  and could get no farther    Please let me through   she said   I belong to him  He is mine    They turned and looked at her    She s  is mother   said a voice   Let  er through     Mother be blowed   said another voice  hoarsely   Get out  She s  is wife     Yes   she cried eagerly   Yes  Oh  do let me through  I am his wife    Suddenly she knew it was true  The Boy s great love had made her his wife  Had he not said   You and I are one  Christobel  eternally  indissolubly one  You will find it out  when it is too late    The crowd parted  making a way for her  straight to the foot of the breakwater   She mounted it  and walked towards the empty stretcher   The coast guardsman confronted her    He is mine   she said  quietly   I have the right to be here    The man saluted  in respectful silence   She stood gazing out to where the crowd of boats hovered about the great insect with broken wings   The sea gleamed golden in the sunset   One boat  larger than the rest  slowly detached itself from the general mel e  pulling with measured stroke toward the breakwater   Something lay very still in the bow  covered with a sail cloth   Two coast guardsmen rowed  one steered   The boat came toward the breakwater  in a shaft of sunlight   Christobel turned to the man beside her    Is there any hope   she asked     Fraid not  lady  My mate just signalled  all U P     Ah   she said  looking wide eyed into his face   Ah  But there must be pioneers    The coast guardsman turned and walked toward the crowd    She s  is wife  men   he said  with a jerk of his thumb over his shoulder   She s  is wife  yet when I told her it was all U P  she said   There must be pioneers     The crowd of roughs doffed their caps   The boat drew slowly nearer   Then she saw the Professor  hurrying down the shingle  waving his umbrella   He must not come yet   She advanced to the shore end of the breakwater  and spoke to the crowd    Please   she said   oh  please  if possible  prevent that gentleman from reaching the breakwater    They turned  and saw the advancing figure of the Professor  flurried and irate     Ullo  Bill   cried a voice   She says  Don t  let the old bloke through    They passed the word from one to the other   Don t  let the old bloke through   They closed the outer ranks  standing shoulder to shoulder  The Professor s umbrella waved wildly on the outskirts   She moved along the breakwater  Yes  that was it   Don t  let the old bloke through   She had never used such a word in her life before  but it just met the needs of the case   Don t  let the old bloke through    The boat drew nearer   A bugle  away up on the cliff  sounded the call to arms    Little Boy Blue  come blow me your horn  The cow s in the meadow  the sheep  in the corn  Where is the boy who looks after the sheep  Ah  dear God  Where is the Boy  Where is the Boy  Where is the Boy  He s under the sailcloth fast asleep    The boat drew nearer  She could hear the measured plash of the oars  the rhythmic rattle of the rowlocks  They advanced  to the beat of the words in her brain    There must be pion eers  Don t  let the old bloke through  Oh  where is the boy who looks after the sheep  He s under the sail cloth  fast asleep    The boat drew level with the breakwater  grating against it    Under the sail cloth  Boy dear  under the sail cloth fast asleep    Tenderly  carefully  they lifted their burden  As the boat rocked  and their feet shuffled beneath the weight  she closed her eyes  When she opened them once more  the quiet Thing under the sail cloth lay upon the stretcher  Every man within sight stood silent and bareheaded   The bugle on the cliff sounded   lights out    The golden shaft of sunlight died from off the sea   Then she came forward  and knelt beside her Boy   Suddenly she understood the cry of anguish wrung from the loving heart of a woman at a tomb   Tell me where thou hast laid Him  and I will take Him away   Oh  faithful heart of woman  alike through all the ages  ready  with superhuman effort  to prove a limitless love and a measureless grief   She knelt beside the stretcher  and lifted the sail cloth   Yes  it was the Boy her own Little Boy Blue   His curly hair was matted with blood and salt water  There was a deep gash across his temple  from the ear  right up into the hair His eyes were closed  but his lips smiled  triumphant   There must be pioneers  Every good life given  advances the cause    Yes  Little Boy Blue  But has it ever struck you  that  if you marry  your wife will most probably want you to give up flying  not being able to bear that a man who was her ALL  should do these things   She lifted the sail cloth quite away  and stood looking down upon him  so shattered  yet so beautiful  in his triumphant sleep   Suddenly her arm was seized from behind  She turned   The Professor had succeeded in pushing his way through the crowd  and in mounting the breakwater  His cravat was awry  his top hat was on the back of his head  He looked at her through his glasses  in amazed indignation    Christobel   he said   this is no place for you  Come away at once  Do you hear  I bid you come with me at once    The only thing she really minded was that his hat was on  in the presence of her Dead   She could not free her arm from the grip of the Professor   She turned and pointed to the stretcher  with her left hand    My place is here   she said  clearly and deliberately   I have the right to be here  This is all a fearful nightmare  from which we are bound before long to wake  But meanwhile  I tell you plainly as I ought to have told you before this is the body of the man I love    At that moment  one of the crowd  springing on to the breakwater behind the Professor  struck off his hat with a cane  It fell into the sea   The Professor let go her arm  and turned to see who had perpetrated the outrage  and whether the hat could be recovered   Then she bent over the stretcher    Boy dear   she whispered  in tones of ineffable tenderness   this is where they have laid you  but I will take you away    She put her arms beneath the body  then  with an almost superhuman effort  lifted it  and gathered it to her  It felt limp and broken  The head fell heavily against her breast  The blood and salt water soaked through her thin muslin blouse  But she held him  and would not let him go   I will take him away   she whispered   I will take him away    She knew she was losing her reason  but she had known that  ever since she first looked down from the top of the cliff  and saw the broken wings floating on the sea  Now  with her Boy in her arms  her one idea was to get away from the Professor  away from the coast guardsmen  away from the crowd   Turning her back upon the beach  she staggered along the breakwater  toward the open sea    I will take him away   she repeated   I will take him away    Then her foot slipped  She still held the Boy  but she felt herself falling   She closed her eyes   She never knew which she struck first  the stone breakwater  or the sea      THE SEVENTH DAY  THE STONE IS ROLLED AWAY  When Christobel recovered consciousness and opened her eyes  she found herself in bed  in her own room  at home   Martha bent over her   The morning light entered dimly  through closed curtains   In dumb anguish of mind  she looked up into Martha s grim old face    Tell me where you have laid him   she said   and I will take him away    Martha snorted    I ve  laid your tea tray on the table beside your bed  Miss   she said   and when you  ave finished with it  I will take it away    Whereupon  Martha lumbered to the large bow window  drew back all the curtains with a vigorous clatter of brass rings  and let in a blaze of morning sunshine   Christobel lay quite still  trying to collect her thoughts   One of her pillows was clasped tightly in her arms   She lifted her left hand  and looked at it   No ring encircled the third finger    Martha   she called  softly   Martha loomed large at the side of the bed    What is to day     Wednesday  Miss   replied Martha  too much surprised to be contemptuous    Martha where is Mr  Chelsea     Lord only knows   said Martha  tragically    Martha is he living     Living   repeated Martha  deliberately  Then she smiled  her crooked smile   Living don t  express it  Miss Christobel  Lively s more like it  when Mr  Guy is concerned  And I reckon  wherever  e is  e s makin  things lively somewhere for somebody  You don t  look quite the thing this morning  Miss  Sit up and take your tea    She sat up  loosing the pillow out of her arms the pillow which had been  first her Little Boy Blue  as she drew him to her in the darkness  then the dead body of Guy Chelsea  as she lifted it on the breakwater   She took her tea from Martha s hand  and drank it quickly  She wanted Martha to go   It was Wednesday  Then the Boy had left her only the day before yesterday  His telegram had come last night  The Professor s proposal had not yet reached her   Martha lifted the tray and departed   Then Christobel Charteris rose  and stood at her open window  in the morning sunlight  She looked out upon the mulberry tree and the long vista of soft turf  in the dim distance  the postern gate in the old red wall his paradise  and hers   She lifted her beautiful arms above her head  The loose sleeves of her nightdress fell away  baring them to the elbows  She might have stood  in her noble development of face and form  for a splendid statue of hope and praise    Ah  dear God   she breathed   is it indeed true  Is it possible  Is my Boy alive  And am I free free to be his alone  Am I free to give him all he wants  free to be all he needs    She stood long at the window motionless  realizing the mental adjustment which had come to her during the strenuous hours of the night   Her dream had taught her one great lesson  That under no circumstances whatever  can it be right for a woman to marry one man  while with her whole being she loves another  Love is Lord of all  Love reigns paramount  No expectations  past or present  based on friendship or gratitude  no sense of duty or obligations of any kind could make a marriage right  if  in view of that marriage  Love had to stand by with broken wings   She felt quite sure  now  that she could never marry the Professor  and humbly she thanked God for opening her eyes to the wrong she had contemplated  before it was too late   But there still remained the difficult prospect of having to disappoint a man she esteemed so highly  a man who had been led to believe she cared for him  and had waited years for him  a man who  for years  had set his heart upon her  This was a heavy stone  and it lay right in the path of perfect bliss which she longed to tread with her Little Boy Blue   Who should roll it away   Could she feel free to take happiness with the Boy  if she had disappointed and crushed a deeply sensitive nature which trusted her   She dressed  and went down to the breakfast room  her soul filled  in spite of perplexities  with a radiance of glad thanksgiving   Martha and Jenkins came in to prayers  Martha had now taken to curling all her wisps  She appeared with many frizzled ringlets  kept in place by invisible pins   Martha always came in to prayers  as if she were marching at the head of a long row of men and maids  Jenkins followed meekly  placing his chair at what would have been the tail of Martha s imaginary retinue  According to the triumphant dignity of Martha s entry  Jenkins placed his chair near or far away  Martha was in great form to day  Jenkins sat almost at the door  If the door bell rang during prayers  the first ring was tacitly ignored  but if it rang again  Martha signed to Jenkins  who tiptoed reverently out  and answered it  No matter how early in the morning s devotions the interruption occurred  Jenkins never considered it etiquette to return  Miss Charteris used to dread a duet alone with Martha  She always became too intensely conscious of herself and of Martha  to be uplifted as usual by the inspired words of Bible and Prayer book  The presence of Jenkins at once constituted a congregation   On this particular morning  no interruptions occurred   The portion for the day chanced to be the scene at the empty tomb  in the early dawn of that first Easter Day  as given by Saint Mark   The quiet voice vibrated with unusual emotion as Miss Charteris read     And very early in the morning  the first day of the week  they came unto the sepulchre at the rising of the sun  And they said among themselves  Who shall roll us away the stone from the door of the sepulchre  And when they looked  they saw that the stone was rolled away  for it was very great     Christobel Charteris paused  She seemed to see the shore at Dovercourt  and the brave little figure struggling to carry the heavy stone  and  later on when the cannon ball lay safely in the castle court yard  Little Boy Blue standing erect  with lifted cap  and shining eyes  a picture of faith triumphant    I have prayed for thee  that thy faith fail not    How far were the happenings of this strange night owing to that dead mother s prayers  and to the Boy s unfailing faith  even through these hard days   Miss Charteris could read no farther  She closed the Bible   Let us pray   she said  and turned to the Collect for the week     O God  Whose never failing providence ordereth all things both in heaven and earth  We humbly beseech Thee to put away from us all hurtful things  and to give us those things which be profitable for us  through Jesus Christ our Lord  Amen    On the breakfast table  beside her plate  lay the Professor s letter  She had known it would be there   She poured out her coffee and buttered her toast   Then she opened the letter     My dear Ann    After the nightmare through which she had just passed  this beginning scarcely surprised her  She glanced back at the envelope to make quite sure it was addressed to herself  then read on  It was dated the evening before  from the Professor s rooms in College     MY DEAR ANN  I regret to have been unable to look in upon you this evening  on my return from town  and my duties will keep me from paying you a visit until to morrow  in the late afternoon  Hence this letter    Needless to say  I have been thinking over  carefully  the remarkable statement you saw fit to make to me  concerning the feelings and expectations of our young friend  It came to me as a genuine surprise  I have always looked upon our friendship as purely Platonic  based entirely upon the intellectual enjoyment we found in pursuing our classical studies together    I admit  I cannot bring myself to contemplate matrimony with much enthusiasm    At the same time  your feeling in the matter being so strong  and my sense of gratitude toward my late friend  a thing never to be forgotten  if you are quite sure  Ann and I confess it seems to me altogether incredible that our young friend entertains  toward me  feelings which will mean serious disappointment to her  if I fail     This brought the letter to the bottom of the first page   Without reading any farther  Miss Charteris folded it  and replaced it in the envelope   The indignant blood had mounted to the roots of her soft fair hair  But already  in her heart  sounded a song of wondering praise     And when they looked  they saw that the stone was rolled away  for it was very great     The iron gate of the front garden swung open  Hurried steps flew up the path  Emma  poor soul  had been told to fly  and Emma had flown  She almost fell into the arms of Jenkins  as he opened the hall door   The note with which Emma had run  at a speed which was now causing her  such a stitch as never was   came from Miss Ann  and was marked  urgent  and  immediate    The corners of Christobel s proud mouth curved into a quiet smile as she took it from the salver  She had expected this note    Take Emma downstairs  Jenkins   she said   Ask Martha to give her a cup of coffee  and an egg  if she fancies it  Tell Emma  I wish her to sit down comfortably and rest  The answer to this note will be ready in about half an hour  not before    Miss Charteris finished her coffee and toast  poured out a fresh cup  and took some marmalade  She did not hurry over her breakfast   When she had quite finished  she rose  and walked over to the writing table  She sat down  opened her blotter  took paper and envelopes  found a pen  and tried it   Then she opened Miss Ann s letter  marked  urgent  and  immediate      SWEETEST CHILD   wrote Miss Ann   See what Kenrick has done  We you and I so understand his dear absent minded ways  He wrote this letter to you last night  and  owing to his natural emotion and tension of mind  addressed it to me  Needless to say  I have read only the opening sentences  Darling Christobel  you will  I feel sure  overlook the very natural mistake  and not allow it in any way to affect your answer to my brother s proposal  Remember how difficult it is for great minds to be accurate in the small details of daily life  I have known Kenrick to put two spoonfuls of mustard into a cup of coffee  stir it round  and drink it  quite unaware that anything was wrong I have indeed  See how our dear Professor needs a wife    I feel quite foolishly anxious this morning  Do send me one line of assurance that all is well  You cannot but be touched by my brother s letter  From beginning to end  it breathes the faithful devotion of a lifetime  Do not misunderstand the natural reticence of one wholly unaccustomed to the voicing of sentiment  I only wish you could hear all he says to me     Then followed a few prayers and devout allusions to Providence which brought a stern look to the face of Miss Charteris and  with a whiff of effusive sentiment  Ann Harvey closed her epistle   An open letter from the Professor to herself was enclosed  but this  Christobel quietly laid aside   She took pen and paper  and wrote at once the note for which Emma waited     DEAR ANN  I enclose a letter from your brother which came  addressed to me  this morning  but was evidently intended for you  I have read only the first page  which was quite sufficient to make the true state of affairs perfectly clear to me    Providence has indeed interposed  by means of the Professor s absent minded ways  to prevent the wrecking of three lives mine  your brother s  and that of the man I love  to whom I shall be betrothed before the day is over    I shall not tell the Professor that I have seen a portion of his letter to you  I think we owe it to him not to do so  He has always been a true and honourable friend to me    Yours   C  C    When Emma had duly departed with this letter and enclosure  Miss Charteris breathed more freely  She had been afraid lest  in her righteous indignation  in her consciousness of the terrible mischief so nearly wrought  she should write too strongly to Miss Ann  thus causing her unnecessary pain   It was quite impossible  to the fine generosity of a nature such as that of Christobel Charteris  really to understand the mean  self centred  unscrupulous dishonesty of an action such as this of Miss Ann s  From the calm heights whereon she walked  such small minded selfishness of motive did not come within her field of vision  She could never bring herself to believe worse of Miss Ann than that  in some incomprehensible way  she had laboured under a delusion regarding herself and the Professor   Miss Ann disposed of  she turned to the Professor s letter   It was not the letter of her dream  by any means  nor was it the letter she had sometimes dreamed he would write   It was straightforward and simple  and  holding the key to the situation  she could read between the lines a certain amount of dismayed surprise  which made her heartily sorry for her old friend   The Professor touched on their long friendship  his regard for her parents  his sincere admiration for herself  their unity of interests and congeniality of tastes  his sudden change of fortunes  quoted a little Greek  a little Sanskrit  and a little Persian  then  fortified by these familiar aids to the emotions  offered her marriage  in valiant and unmistakable terms   Christobel s heart stood still as she realized that not one word in that letter would have revealed to her the true state of the case  Truly  under Providence  she had cause to bless the Professor s  dear absent minded ways    As she took pen and paper to reply to his letter  her heart felt very warm toward her old friend  She gave him full credit for the effort with which he had done what he had been led to consider was the right thing toward her     MY DEAR PROFESSOR   she wrote    I rejoice to hear of your good fortune  It is well indeed when the great thinkers of the world are rendered independent of all anxious taking of thought as to what they shall eat  or what they shall drink  or wherewithal they shall be clothed  I like to think of you  my friend  as now set completely free from all mundane cares  able to give your undivided attention to the work you love    I appreciate  more than I can say  the kind proposition concerning myself  which you make in your letter  I owe it to our friendship to tell you quite frankly that I feel  and have long felt  how great an honour it would be for any woman to be in a position so to administer your household as to set you completely free for your great intellectual pursuits    But marriage would mean more than this  and our long friendship emboldens me to say that I should grieve to see you owing perhaps to pressure or advice from others burden your life with family ties for which you surely do not yourself feel any special inclination    And  now  my friend  I must not close my letter without telling you how great a happiness has come into my lonely life  I am about to marry a man whom   Miss Charteris paused  and looked through the open window to the softly moving leaves of the old mulberry tree  A gleam of amusement shone in her eyes  curving her lips into a tender smile  The Boy seemed beside her  slapping his knee and rocking with merriment at the way she was about to bewilder Miss Ann and the Professor  a man whom I have known and loved for over twenty years    I am sure you will wish me joy  dear Professor    Believe me  always   Gratefully and affectionately yours   CHRISTOBEL CHARTERIS    She rang the bell  and sent the answer to the Professor s letter  by Jenkins  She could not wait for the slow medium of the post  She could not let him remain another hour in the belief that  in order to save her from disappointment  he was compelled to marry Christobel Charteris   She stood at the breakfast room window  and watched Jenkins as he hurried down the garden with the note  Going by the lane  and taking a short cut across the fields  he would reach the Professor s rooms in a quarter of an hour  Until then  life was somewhat intolerable   The proud blood mantled again over the face  the strong sweet beauty of which the Boy so loved  Her letter to the Professor had not been easy to write  She had had to be true to herself  and true to him  in the light of what she knew to be his real feeling in the matter  bearing in mind that before long he would almost certainly learn from Miss Ann that she had replied to his proposal after having read his sentiments on the subject  so candidly expressed on the first page of his letter to his sister   To relieve her mind  after this intricate whirl of cross correspondence  she took up the Daily Graphic  and opened it  casually turning the pages   Suddenly there looked out at her from the central page  the merry  handsome  daring face of her own Little Boy Blue  He was seated in his flying machine steering wheel in hand  looking out from among many wires  His cap was on the back of his head  his bright eyes looked straight into hers  his firm young lips  parted in a smile  seemed to say   I jolly well mean to do it   It was the very picture she had seen in the Professor s Daily Mirror  in her dream of the night before  Below was an account of the flight from Folkestone which he was about to attempt   Then she remembered  with a shock of realization  that the flight across the Channel  round Boulogne Cathedral and back  was to take place on that very day  His telegram  of the night before  had said   I am going to do a big fly to morrow  Wish me luck   Ah  what if it ended as she had seen it end in her dream  great broken wings  a mass of tangled wire  and the Boy her Boy with matted hair  and wounded head  asleep beneath the sailcloth   Her heart stood still   With their perfect joy so near its fulfilment  she could not let him take the risk  Was there time to stop him   She looked at the paper  The start was for   p m  It was now eleven o clock   She remembered his last words   When you want me and send why  I will come from the other end of the world    She never quite knew how she reached the telegraph office  It seemed almost as dreamlike as her flight from the top to the bottom of the Folkestone cliffs  But it was not a dream this time  it was desperate reality   Why do people always break the points of the pencils hanging from strings in the telegraph offices  Surely it is possible to write a telegram without stubbing off the pencil  and leaving it in that condition  for the next person in a hurry   She flew from compartment to compartment  and at last produced her own pencil  and wrote her telegram in the final section of the row  independent of official broken points     Do not fly to day  Come to me  I want you    Christobel     She addressed it to the hotel from which he had telegraphed on the previous day  but added to the address   If not there  send immediately to aviation sheds   She had no idea what to call the places  but this sounded well  and seemed an intuition  or an unconscious recollection of some remark of the Boy s   She handed it over the counter   Please see that it goes through at once   she said   The clerk knew her   Yes  Miss Charteris   he replied  He began reading the message aloud  but almost immediately stopped  and checked the words off silently  He glanced at the clock   It should be there before noon  Miss Charteris   he said   He did not look at her  as he passed her the stamps  He had long thought her one of the finest women who stepped in and out of the post office  He had never expected to see her hands tremble  And fancy any woman even she being able to tell Guy Chelsea not to fly  He had a bet on  about that flight  with an enthusiastic backer of Chelsea s  He was glad he had taken the odds against its coming off  before seeing this wire  But after all  It is easy enough to ask a chap not to fly  but   He took up a copy of the Daily Mirror  and looked at the brave smiling face   I jolly well mean to do it   the young aeronaut seemed to be saying  The clerk laughed  and shook his head   Hurry up that wire   he called to the operator  Then he jingled the loose change in his pockets   I wonder   he said   During the hours which followed  Christobel Charteris knew suspense   Perhaps that strong  self contained nature could never have fully sounded the depths of its own surrender  without those hours of uncertainty  when nothing stood between her and the man she loved  but the possibility that her telegram would fail to reach him  that he would carry out his dangerous flight  that disaster and death would overtake him and wrest him from her  and that he would die Guy Chelsea would die without ever knowing of the cup of bliss she was now ready  with utterly loving hand  to hold to his lips   Having sent her message  there was nothing more she could do  and the burden of inaction seemed almost too great a weight to carry  during the hours which must elapse  before his coming could turn uncertainty into assurance  restlessness  into peace   It did not occur to her  as a possibility  that Guy Chelsea would elect to fly  after receiving her request  She knew her slightest wish would be law to the Boy s tender loyalty  and though he knew nothing of her cause for anxiety  nor of the complete change of circumstances since he left her  not forty eight hours before  she felt sure he would not fly  she felt certain he would come if if the message reached him in time   At two o clock it came to her  with overwhelming certainty  that her message had not reached him  and that he had started on his flight  She seemed to see the great wings mounting mounting  then skimming over the sea  She almost heard the hum he had so often described the hum of the giant insect on which the bird man flew   Her own Little Boy Blue was flying through space  O God  what might not any minute be bringing  He had said   One never expects those things to happen  and when they do happen  it s over so quickly that there is no time for expectation   Was it happening now  Was it going to be over so quickly  that her cup of bliss would be dashed from her lips untasted  Was she to lose her all  because of a cross current or a twisted wire   She was walking up and down the garden now  and paused beside the chair in which she had sat when he had said  only seven days ago   It was always you I wanted  not your niece  Good heavens  How can you have thought it was Mollie  when it was you you just only you  all the time   And she  half laughing at him  had asked   Is this a proposal     My ALL   she said   Oh  Boy dear  my ALL  If I lose you  I lose my ALL    She walked on slowly  moving to the repetition of those words  It seemed a comfort to repeat the great fact that  at last  he was this to her  Surely it would reach him  by some sort of wireless telegraphy through space  Surely it would control cross currents  keep propellers acting as they should  steering gear from twisting    O God  he is my ALL he is my ALL    The afternoon sun began to glint through the trees   The jolly little  what d  you call  ems  lifted pale anxious faces to the sky   Clocks all around chimed the hour of four   Suddenly her limbs weakened  She could walk no longer   She sank into a chair  beneath the mulberry tree   In a few minutes Jenkins would bring out tea  Would Martha have arranged a tea such as the Boy loved  with cups for two  hot buttered toast and explosive buns   What a boy he was  at heart this man who had won her  what a gay  laughter loving boy   She lay back  very still  under the mulberry tree  and lived again through each of the Boy s days  from the first to the sixth   She kept her eyes closed  The sunlight  glinting through the mulberry leaves  fell in bright patches on her white gown  and on her soft golden hair   The garden was very still  All nature seemed waiting with the heart that waited    Little Boy Blue  come blow me your horn     I shall blow it all right on the seventh day   the Boy had said   and when I do  you will hear it    This was the seventh day    Suddenly the horn of a motor tooted loudly in the lane   She rose  her hands clasped upon her breast  and stood waiting  A shaft of golden sunlight streamed down the garden  and seemed to focus on the postern gate   Then the gate swung open and the Boy came in  slamming it behind him  She saw him coming up the lawn toward her  bareheaded  the sunlight in his shining eyes    I couldn t  wait for trains   he shouted   I came by motor  And I jolly well exceeded the speed limit all the way    She moved a few steps to meet him    Boy dear   she said   you always exceed all speed limits  It is a way you have  Exceed them as much as you like  so long as I am with you when you do it  But oh  my Little Boy Blue  don t  fly again  for  if you fall and break your wings  indeed you will break my heart    In a moment she was sobbing on his breast  her arms flung around him  There was nothing broken or limp about his strong young body  pulsating with life   He put his arms about her  holding her in a clasp of close possessive tenderness   He did not yet understand what had happened  but he knew the great gift he desired had been given him  He waited for her to speak   She lifted her face to his    Guy   she said   ah  take me  hold me  keep me  I am altogether your own  I will explain to you fully  by and by  The stone was very great  but lo  as we reached it  the Angel of the Lord had rolled it away     No other man has a shadow of claim over me  I am free to say  to the only man I have ever really loved  Take me  I am yours  Oh  Boy  I am altogether yours    He bent over her   The sweet proud lips were parted in utter surrender  and lifted to his   He paused just for one exquisite moment  of realization   She waited his kiss with closed eyes  so she did not see the radiance of his face  as he looked up to the blue sky  flecked with fleeting white clouds  But she heard the voice  which from that hour was to make the music of her life    Thank the Lord   said Little Boy Blue   Then he kissed her    And the evening and the morning were the seventh day    \n"

       "' through the postern gate  a romance in seven days    by  florence l  barclay   author of   the rosary    the mistress of shenstone    the following of the star   etc    london and new york  g  p  putnam s sons              th thousand    made and printed in great britain by the camelot press limited  southampton     to  my mother     contents   the first day  the story of little boy blue   the second day  miss charteris takes control   the third day  the boy invades the kitchen   the fourth day  christobel signs her name   the fifth day  guy chelsea takes control   the sixth day  miss ann has  much to say    an interlude   as a dream  when one awaketh    the seventh day  the stone is rolled away     the first day  the story of little boy blue   but it was not your niece  it was always you i wanted   said the boy   he lay back  in a deep wicker chair  under the old mulberry tree  he had taken the precaution of depositing his cup and saucer on the soft turf beneath his chair  because he knew that  under the stress of sudden emotion  china especially the best china had a way of flying off his knee  and there was no question as to the exquisite quality of the china on the dainty tea table over which miss christobel charteris presided   the boy had watched her pouring the tea into those pretty rose leaf cups  nearly every afternoon during the golden two weeks just over  he knew every movement of those firm white hands  so soft  yet so strong and capable   the boy used to stand beside her  ready to hand mollie s cup  as punctiliously as if a dozen girls had been sitting in the old garden  waiting to be quickly served by the only man   the boy enjoyed being the only man  also he had quite charming manners  he never allowed the passing of bread and butter to interfere with the flow of conversation  yet the bread and butter was always within reach at the precise moment you wanted it  though the boy s bright eyes were fixed just then in keenest interest on the person who happened to be speaking  and not a point of the story  or a word of the remark  was missed either by him or by you   he used to watch the aunt s beautiful hands very closely  and at last  every time he looked at them  his brown eyes kissed them  the boy thought this was a delightful secret known only to himself  but one day  when he was bending over her  holding his own cup while she filled it  the aunt suddenly said   don t    it was so startling and unexpected  that the cup almost flew out of his hand  the boy might have said   don t  what   which would have put the aunt in a difficulty  because it would have been so very impossible to explain  but he was too honest  he at once didn t   and felt a little shy for five minutes  then recovered  and hugged himself with a fearful joy at the thought that she had known his eyes had kissed her dear beautiful hands  then stole a look at her calm face  so completely unmoved in its classic beauty  and thought he must have been mistaken  only what on earth else could she have said  don t    about  at that moment   but mollie was there  then  so no explanations were possible  now at last  thank goodness  mollie had gone  and his own seven days had begun  this was the first day  and he was going to tell her everything  there was absolutely nothing he would not be able to tell her  the delight of this fairly swept the boy off his feet  he had kept on the curb so long  and he was not used to curbs of any kind   he lay back  his hands behind his head  and watched the aunt s kind face  through half closed lids  his brown eyes were shining  but very soft  when the aunt looked at them  she quickly looked away    how could you think the attraction would be gone   he said   it was always you  i wanted  not your niece  good heavens  how can you have thought it was mollie  when it was you you  just only you  all the time    the aunt raised her beautiful eyebrows and looked him straight in the face    is this a proposal   she asked  quietly    of course it is   said the boy   and jolly hard it has been  having to wait two whole weeks to make it  i want you to marry me  christobel  i dare say you think me a cheeky young beggar to suggest it  point blank  but i want you to give me seven days  and  in those seven days  i am going to win you  then it will seem to you  as it does to me  the only possible thing to do    his brown eyes were wide open now  and the glory of the love shining out from them dazzled her  she looked away   then the swift colour swept over the face which all cambridge considered classic in its stern strong beauty  and she laughed  but rather breathlessly    you amazing boy   she said   do you consider it right to take away a person s breath  in this fashion  or are you trying to be funny     i have no designs on your breath   said the boy   and it is my misfortune  but not my fault  if i seem funny   then he sat forward in his chair  his elbows on his knees  and both brown hands held out towards her   i want you to understand  dear   he continued  earnestly   that i have said only a very little of all i have to say  but i hope that little is to the point  and i jolly well mean it    the aunt laughed again  and swung the toe of her neat brown shoe  a habit she had  when trying to appear more at ease than she felt    it is certainly to the point   she said   there can be no possible doubt about that  but are you aware  dear boy  that i have been assiduously chaperoning you and my niece  during the past two weeks  and watching  with the affectionate interest of a middle aged relative  the course of true love running with satisfactory and unusual smoothness    the boy ignored the adjectives and innuendoes  and went straight to the point  he always had a way of ignoring all side issues or carefully introduced irrelevancy  it made him a difficult person to deal with  if the principal weapon in your armoury was elaborate argument    why did you say  don t     asked the boy   the aunt fell at once into the unintentional trap  she dropped her calmly amused manner and answered hurriedly  while again the swift colour flooded her face   boy dear  i hardly know  it was something you did  which  for a moment  i could not quite bear  something passed from you to me  too intimate  too sweet  to be quite right  i said  don t    as involuntarily as one would say  don t   to a threatened blow     it wasn t  a blow   said the boy  tenderly   it was a kiss  every time i looked at your dear beautiful hand  lifting the silver teapot  i kissed it  didn t  you feel it was a kiss     no  i only felt it was unusual  something i could not understand  and i did not like it  therefore i said  don t       but you admit it was sweet   persisted the boy    exactly   replied the aunt   quite incomprehensibly sweet  and i do not like things i cannot comprehend  especially with amazing boys about     didn t  you know it was love   asked the boy  softly    no   replied the aunt  emphatically   most certainly  i did not    the boy got up  and came and knelt beside the arm of her chair    it was love   he said  his lips very close to the soft waves of her hair    go back to your seat at once   said the aunt  sternly   the boy went    and where does poor mollie come in  in all this   inquired the aunt  with some asperity    mollie   said the boy  complacently   oh  mollie understood all right  she loves phil  you know  intends to stick to him  and knows you will back her  the last part of the time  i brought her notes from phil  every day  don t  be angry  dear  you would have done it yourself  if mollie and phil had got hold of you  and implored you to be a go between  you remember the day we invaded the kitchen to see how martha made those little puffy buns you know the explosives  you pinch them in the middle  and they burst into hundreds and thousands of little pieces  jolly things for a stiff stand up in a crowd and all hold your own cups kind of drawing room party  what we used to call  a perpendicular  in my cambridge days  i suppose they still keep up the name  fancy those little buns exploding all over the place  and when you try to pick up the fragments  they go into simply millions of crumbs  between your agitated fingers and anxious thumb    the boy slapped his knee in intense enjoyment  and momentarily lost the thread of the conversation  the aunt s mind was not sufficiently detached to feel equal to a digression into peals of laughter over this vision of the explosive buns  she wanted to find out how much mollie knew  when the boy had finished rocking backwards and forwards in his chair  she suggested  tentatively   you went to the kitchen      oh  yes   said the boy  recovering   we went to the kitchen to watch martha make them  and to get the recipe  you see mollie wanted them for her father s clerical  at homes   oh  i say fancy  the archdeacons and curates  the rectors and vicars  all standing in a solemn crowd on the bishop s best velvet pile carpet  then mollie  so demure  handing round the innocent looking little buns  and  hey presto  the pinching begins  and the explosions  and the hopeless attempts to gather up the fragments    the boy nearly went off again  but he suddenly realized that the aunt was not amused  and pulled himself together    well  we stopped on the way to the kitchen for mutual confidences  it was not easy  bounded as we were by you on the one side  and martha on the other  we had to whisper  i dare say you thought we were kissing behind the door  but we jolly well weren t   she told me about phil  and i told her oh  i told her something of what i am trying to tell you  just enough to make her understand  so that we could go ahead  and play the game fair  all round  she was awfully glad  because she said   i have long feared my dear beautiful aunt would marry an ichthyosaurus   i asked her what the what the i mean  what on earth the meaning of that was  and she said   an old fossil     again the swift flush swept over the calm face  but this time the aunt went off  intentionally  on a side issue    i have heard you say  what the deuce  before now  boy  but i am glad you appear to realize  judging by your laboured efforts to suppress them  that these expressions shock me    she looked at him  quizzically  through half closed lids  but the boy was wholly earnest    well  you see   he said   i am trying most awfully hard to be  in every respect  just what you would wish the man who loves you should be     oh  you dear boy   said christobel charteris  a flood of sudden feeling softening her face   i must make you understand that i cannot possibly take you seriously  i shall have to tell you a story no one has ever heard before  a tender little story of a long ago past  i must tell you the story of my little boy blue  wait here a few moments  while i go indoors and give orders that we are not to be disturbed    rising  she passed up the lawn to the little white house  the boy s eyes followed her  noting with pride and delight the tall athletic figure  fully developed  gracious in its ample lines  yet graceful in the perfect swing of the well poised walk  during all his college years he had known that walk  admired that stately figure  he had been in the set which called her  juno  and  the goddess   which crowded to the clubs if there was a chance of watching her play tennis  and now  during two wonderful weeks  he had been admitted  a welcomed guest  to this little old world oasis  bounded by high red brick walls  where she dwelt and ruled  quiet  sunny  happy hours he had spent in the hush of the old garden  strolling up and down the long narrow velvet turf  beneath the spreading trees  from the green postern gate in the right hand corner of the bottom wall  to the flight of stone steps leading up to the garden door of the little white house   the boy knew  by now  exactly what he wanted  he wanted to marry christobel charteris   he must have been rather a brave boy  he looked very youthful and slim as he lay back in his chair  watching the stately proportions of the woman on whom he had set his young heart  very slight and boyish  in his silver grey suit  with lavender tie  and buttonhole of violas  the boy was very particular about his ties and buttonholes  they always matched  this afternoon  for the first time  he had arrived without a buttonhole  in the surprise and pleasure of his unexpected appearance  the aunt had moved quickly down the sunlit lawn to meet and greet him   mollie had departed  early that morning  her final words at the railway station  as her impish little face smiled farewell from the window of her compartment  had been   mind  auntie dear  no mistake about guy chelsea  he s a charming fellow  and thank you ever so much for giving me such a good time with him  but you can report to papa  that guy chelsea  and his beautiful properties  and his prospective peerage  and his fifty thousand a year  and his motor cars  and his flying machines  are absolutely powerless to tempt me away from my allegiance to phil  beside  it so happens  guy himself is altogether in love with some one else    the train having begun to move at the words  you can report to papa   mollie finished the remainder of the sentence in a screaming crescendo  holding on to her hat with one hand  and waving a tiny lace pocket handkerchief  emphatically  with the other  even then  the aunt lost most of the sentence  and disbelieved the rest  the atmosphere of love had been so unmistakable during those two weeks  the superabundant overflow had even reached herself more than once  with an almost startling thrill of emotion   the boy had been so full of vivid  glowing joie de vivre  radiating fun and gaiety around him   in their sets of tennis  played on her own court across the lane at the bottom of the garden  when she could beat him easily were he handicapped by partnership with mollie  but in genuine singles  when mollie had tactfully collapsed on to a seat and declared herself exhausted  his swift agility counterbalanced her magnificent service  and they were so evenly matched that each game proved a keen delight   in the quiet teas beneath the mulberry tree  where the incomprehensible atmosphere of unspoken tenderness gilded the light words and laughter  as sunlight touches leaf and flower to gold   at the cosy dinners  to which they sometimes asked him  sitting in the garden afterwards in the moonlight  when he would tell them thrilling tales of aviation  describing his initial flights  hairbreadth escapes  the joys of rapid soaring  the dangers of cross currents  broken propellers  or twisted steering gear   on all these occasions  the boy with his enthusiasm  his fun  and his fire had been the life of the happy trio   during those evenings  in the moonlight  when he started off on airships  one heart stood still very often while the boy talked  but it stood still  silently  it was mollie who clasped her hands and implored him never to fly again  then  in the next breath  begged him to take her as a passenger  on the first possible occasion   happy days  but mollie was the attraction  therefore  with mollie s departure  they would naturally come to an end   the boy had not asked if he might come again  and  for the moment  she forgot that the boy rarely asked for what he wanted  he usually took it   she had a lonely luncheon  spent the afternoon over letters and accounts  picking up the dull threads of things laid aside during the gay holiday time   it was not the professor s day for calling  she was alone until four  then she went out and sat under the mulberry  the garden was very quiet  the birds  hour of silence was barely over   jenkins  the butler  had been sent into the town  so martha brought out tea  as ample  as carefully arranged  as ever  and cups for two    why two cups  martha   queried miss charteris  languidly    maybe there ll be a visitor   said martha in grim prophetic tones  then her hard old face relaxed and creased into an unaccustomed smile   maybe there is a visitor   she added  softly  for at that moment the postern gate banged  and they saw the boy coming up the garden  in a shaft of sunlight   the aunt walked quickly to meet him  his arrival was so unexpected  and she had been so lonely  and so dull    how nice of you   she said   with the attraction gone  but martha seems to have had a premonition of your coming  she has just brought out tea  most suggestively arranged for two  how festive you are  boy  why this wedding attire  are you coming from  or going to  a function  no  then don t  you want tennis after tea a few good hard sets  just we two  unhandicapped by our dear little mollie     no   said the boy   talk  please  to day  just we two  unhandicapped by our dear little mollie  talk please  not tennis    he paused beside the border  full of mauve and purple flowers   how jolly those little what d  you call  ems look  in the sunshine   he said   then the aunt noticed that he wore no buttonhole  and that his tie was lavender  she picked four of her little violas  and pinned them into his coat    boy dear   she said   you are a dandy in the matter of ties and buttonholes  only it is so essentially you  that one rather enjoys it  but this is the first day i have known you to arrive without one  and have need to fall back upon my garden     it is a first day   said the boy  dropping into step with her  as she moved toward the mulberry tree   it starts a new r gime  in the matter of buttonholes  and other things  i am going to have seven days  and this is the first     really   smiled the aunt  amused at the boy s intense seriousness   i am flattered that you should spend a portion of  the first day  with me  let us have tea  and then you shall tell me why seven days  and where you mean to pass them    the boy was rather silent during tea  the aunt  trying to read his mind  thought at first that he regretted his flannels  and the chance of tennis  then that he was missing mollie  whereupon the aunt repeated her remark that it was nice of him to come  now the attraction was no longer there   this gave him the cue for which he waited  his cup was empty  and safely on the grass  the floodgates of the boy s pent up love and longing burst open  the unforgettable words   it was always you i wanted   were spoken  and now he waited for her  under the mulberry tree  she had something to tell him  but  whatever it might be  it could not seriously affect the situation  he had told her that was the great essential  he would win her in seven days  already she knew just what he wanted a big step for the first day  he looked up  and saw her coming   she had regained her usual calm  her eyes were very kind  she smiled at the boy  gently   she took her seat in a low basket work chair  he had leapt to his feet  she motioned him to another  just opposite hers  she was feeling rather queenly  unconsciously her manner became somewhat regal  the boy enjoyed it  he knew he was bent upon winning a queen among women    i am going to tell you a story   she said    yes   said the boy    it is about my little boy blue     yes     you were my little boy blue     i     yes  twenty years ago     then i was six   said the boy  quite unperturbed    we were staying at dovercourt  on the east coast  our respective families had known each other  i used to watch you playing on the shore  you were a very tiny little boy     i dare say i was quite a nice little boy   said the boy  complacently    indeed you were  quite sweet  you wore white flannel knickers  and a little blue coat     i dare say it was quite a nice little coat   said the boy   and i hope my womenfolk had the tact to call it a  blazer      it was a dear little coat i should say  blazer    said the aunt   and i called you my  little boy blue   you also had a blue flannel cap  which you wore stuck on the back of your curls  i spoke to you twice  little boy blue     did you   he said  and his brown eyes were tender   then no wonder i feel i have loved you all my life     ah  but wait until you hear my story  the first time i spoke to you  it happened thus  your nurse sat high up on the beach  in the long line of nurses  gossiping and doing needlework  you took your little spade and bucket  and marched away  all by yourself  to a breakwater  and there you built a splendid sand castle  i sat on the breakwater  higher up  and watched you  you took immense pains  you overcame stupendous difficulties  and every time your little cap fell off  you picked it up  dusted off the sand with the sleeve of your little blue coat  and stuck it on the back of your curly head again  you were very sweet  little boy blue  i can see you now    the aunt paused  and let her eyes dwell upon the boy in appreciative retrospection  if he felt this something of an ordeal  he certainly showed no signs of it  not for a moment did his face lose its expression of delighted interest    presently   continued the aunt   your castle and courtyard finished  you made a little cannon in the centre of the courtyard  for defence  then you looked around for a cannon ball  this was evidently a weighty matter  and indeed it turned out to be such  you stood your spade against the breakwater  placed your bucket beside it  readjusted your little cap  and trotted off almost to the water s edge  your conception of the size of your castle and cannon must have become magnified with every step of those small sturdy feet  for  arrived at the water  you found a huge round stone nearly as large as your own little head  this satisfied you completely  but you soon found you could not carry it in your hands  you spent a moment in anxious consideration  then you took off your little blue coat  spread it upon the sand  rolled the cannon ball upon it  tied the sleeves around it  picked up the hem and the collar  hoisted the heavy stone  and proceeded slowly and with difficulty up the shore  every moment it seemed as if the stone must fall  and crush the bare toes of my little boy blue  so i flew to the rescue     little boy blue   i said   may i help you to carry your stone     you paused  and looked up at me  i doubt if you had breath to answer while you were walking  your little face was flushed and damp with exertion  the blue cap was almost off  you had sand on your eyebrows  and sand on your little straight nose  but you looked at me with an expression of indomitable courage and pride  and you said   fanks  but i always does my own cawwying   with that you started on  and i fell behind rebuffed     surly little beast   ejaculated the boy    not at all   said the aunt   i won t  have my little boy blue called names  he showed a fine independence of spirit  now hear what happened next    little boy blue had almost reached his castle  with his somewhat large  but otherwise suitable  cannon ball  when his nurse  glancing up from her needlework  perceived him staggering along in his shirt sleeves  and also saw the use to which he was putting his flannel coat  she threw aside the blue over all she was making  rushed down the shore  calling my little boy blue every uncomplimentary compound noun and adjective which entered her irate and flurried mind  seized the precious stone  unwound the little jacket  flung the stone away  shook out the sand and seaweed  and straightened the twisted sleeves  then she proceeded to shake the breath out of my little boy blue s already rather breathless little body  put on the coat  jerked him up the shore  and plumped him down with his back to the sea and his castle  to sit in disgrace and listen  while she told the assembled nurses what a  born himp of hevil  he was  i could have slain that woman  and i knew my little boy blue had no dear mother of his own  i wanted to take him in my arms  smooth his tumbled curls  and comfort him  and all this time he had not uttered a sound  he had just explained to me that he always did his own carrying  and evidently he had learned to bear his childish sorrows in silence  i watched the little disconsolate blue back  usually so gaily erect  now round with shame and woe  then i bethought me of something i could do  i made quite sure he was not peeping round  then i went and found the chosen stone  and it was heavy indeed  i carried it to the breakwater  and deposited it carefully within the courtyard of the castle  then i sat down behind the breakwater  on the other side  and waited  i felt sure little boy blue would come back for his spade and bucket    presently the nurses grew tired of bullying him  the strength of his quiet non resistance proved greater than their superior numbers and brute force  also his intelligent little presence was  undoubtedly  a check upon their gossip  so he was told he might go  i conclude  on the understanding that he should  be a good boy  and carry no more  nasty heavy stones   i saw him rise and shake the dust of the nurses  circle off his little feet  then he pushed back his curls  and  without looking to the right or to the left  trotted straight to his castle  i wondered he did not glance  however hopelessly  in the supposed direction of the desired stone  but  no  he came gaily on  and the light of a great expectation shone in his brown eyes    when he reached the breakwater  and found his castle  there safely in the courtyard reposed the mighty cannon ball  he stood still a moment  looking at it  and his cheeks went very pink  then he pulled off his little cap  and turned his radiant face up to the blue sky  flecked with fleeting white clouds  and  fank de lord   said my little boy blue    there were unconcealed tears in the aunt s kind eyes  and she controlled her quiet voice with difficulty  but the glory of a great gladness had come over the boy  without as yet explaining itself in words  it rang in his voice and laughter    i remember   he said   why  of course i remember  not you  worse luck  but being lugged up the shore  and fearing i had lost my cannon ball  and  you know  as quite a tiny chap  i had formed a habit of praying about all my little wants and woes  i sometimes think  how amused the angels must have been when my small petitions arrived  there was a scarecrow  in a field  i prayed for  regularly  every night  for weeks  i had been struck by the fact that it looked lonely  then i seriously upset the theology of the nursery  by passing through a course of persistent and fervent prayer for satan  it appeared as an obvious logical conclusion to my infant mind  that if the person who according to nurse spent all his time in going about making everybody naughty  could himself become good  all naughtiness would cease  also  that anybody must be considered as  past praying for   was an idea which nearly broke my small heart with rage and misery  when it was first crudely forced upon me  i think the arch fiend must have turned away  silent and nonplussed  if he ever chanced to pass by  while a very tiny boy was kneeling up in his crib  pleading with tearful earnestness   please god  bless poor old satan  make him good an  happy  an  take him back to heaven   but it used to annoy nurse considerably  when she came into the same prayer  with barely a comma between     oh  my little boy blue   cried the aunt   why was i not your mother     thank goodness  you were not   said the boy  imperturbably   i don t  want you for a mother  dear  i want you for my wife     so you had prayed about the stone   remarked the aunt  hurriedly    yes  while seated there in disgrace  i said   please god  let an angel find my cannon ball  which howwid old nurse fwowed away  an  let the angel cawwy it safe to the courtyard of my castle   and i was not at all surprised to find it there  merely very glad  so you see  christobel  you were my guardian angel twenty years ago  no wonder i feel i have known and loved you  all my life     wait until you hear the rest of my story  little boy blue  but i can testify that you were not surprised  your brown eyes were simply shining with faith and expectation  as you trotted down the shore  but who said you might call me  christobel      no one   replied the boy   i thought of it myself  it seemed so perfect to be able to say it on the first of my seven days  and  if you consider  i have never called you  miss charteris   you always seemed to me much too splendid to be  miss  anything  one might as well say  miss joan of arc  or  miss diana of the ephesians   but of course i won t  call you  christobel  if you would rather not     you quite absurd boy   said the aunt  laughing   call me anything you like just for your seven days  but you have not yet told me the meaning or significance of these seven days    the boy sat forward  eagerly    it s like this   he said   i have always loved the story of how the army of israel marched round jericho during seven days  it appeals to me  the well garrisoned  invincible city  with its high walls and barred gates  the silent  determined army  marching round it  once every day  apparently nothing was happening  but  in reality  their faith  enthusiasm  and will power were undermining those mighty walls  and on the seventh day  when they marched round seven times to the blast of the priestly trumpets  at the seventh time  the ordeal of silence was over  leave was given to the great silent host to shout  so the rams  horns sounded a louder blast than ever  and then  with all the pent up enthusiasm born of those seven days of silent marching  the people shouted  down fell the walls of jericho  and up the conquerors went  right into the heart of the citadel     i am prepared to march round in silence  during seven days  but on the seventh day  jericho will be taken     i being jericho  i conclude   remarked the aunt  dryly   i cannot say i have particularly noticed the silence  but that part of the programme would be decidedly dull  so we will omit it  and say  from the first   little boy blue  come blow me your horn      i shall blow it all right  on the seventh day   said the boy   and when i do  you will hear it    he got up  came across  and knelt by the arm of her chair    i shall walk right up into the heart of the citadel   he said   when the gates fly open  and the walls fall down  and there i shall find you  my queen  and together we shall  inherit the kingdom   o dear unconquered citadel  o beautiful  golden kingdom  don t  you wish it was the seventh day now  christobel    his mouth looked so sweet  as he bent over her and said  christobel   with a queer little accent on the final syllable  that the aunt felt momentarily dizzy    go back to your chair  at once  boy   she whispered   and he went   neither spoke a word  for some minutes  the boy lay back  watching the mysterious moving of the mulberry leaves  the triumphant happiness in his face was a rather breathless thing to see  it made you want to hear a great orchestra burst into the hallelujah chorus   the aunt watched the boy  and wondered whether she must tell him about the professor  before the seventh day  and what he would say  when she did tell him  and how jericho would feel when the army of israel  with silent trumpets and banners drooping  marched disconsolate away  leaving its walls still standing  its gates still barred  poor walls  supposed to be so mighty  already they were trembling  if the boy had not been so chivalrously obedient  he could have broken into the citadel  five minutes ago  did he know       she looked at his radiant face     yes  he knew  there were not many things the boy did not know  she must not allow the seven days  even though she could absolutely trust his obedience and his chivalry  she must tell him the rest of the story  and send him away to day  poor invading army  shorn of its glad triumph  poor jericho  left desolate  it was decidedly unusual to be compared to jericho  and diana of the ephesians  and joan of arc  all in the same conversation  and it was rather funny to enjoy it  but then most things which happened by reason of the boy were funny and unusual  he would always come marching  as an army with banners   the professor would drive up to jericho in a fly  and knock a decorous rat tat on the gate  would the walls tremble at that knock  alas  alas  they had never trembled yet  would they ever tremble again  save for the march past of the boy  would the gates ever really fly open  except to the horn blast of little boy blue      the aunt dared not think any longer  she felt she must take refuge in immediate action    boy dear   she said  in her most maternal voice   come down from the clouds  and listen to me  i want to tell you the rest of the story of my little boy blue    he sprang up  and came and sat on the grass at her feet  all the boy s movements were so bewilderingly sudden  they were over and done  before you had time to consider whether or no you intended to allow them  but this new move was quite satisfactory  he looked less big and manly  down on the grass  and she really felt maternal  with his curly head so close to her knee  she even ventured to put out a cool motherly hand and smooth the hair back from his forehead  as she began to speak  she had intended to touch it only once just to accentuate the fact of her motherliness but it was the sort of soft thick hair which seemed meant for the gentle passing through it of a woman s fingers  and the boy seemed to like it  for he gave one long sigh of content  and leaned his head against her knee    now i must tell you   said the aunt   of the only other time when i ventured to speak to my little boy blue  he had come to his favourite place beside the breakwater  the tide had long ago swept away castle  courtyard  and cannon  but the cannon ball was still there  it partook of the nature of  things that remain   heavy stones usually do  when i peeped over the breakwater  little boy blue was sitting on the sand  his sturdy legs were spread wide  his bare toes looked like ten little pink sea shells  between his small brown knees  he had planted his bucket  his right hand wielded a wooden spade  on the handle of which was writ large  in blue pencil  master guy chelsea  he was bent upon filling his bucket with sand  but the spade being long  and the bucket too close to him  boy  leave my shoe alone  it does not require attention  most of the sand missed the bucket  and went over himself  i heard him sigh rather wearily  and say  blow   in a tired little voice  i leaned over the breakwater   little boy blue   i said   may i play with you  and help you to fill your bucket with sand     little boy blue looked up  his curls  his eyebrows  his long dark eyelashes were full of sand  there was sand on his little straight nose  but no amount of sand could detract from the dignity of his little face  or weaken its stern decision  he laid down his spade  put up a damp little hand  and  lifting his blue cap to me  said   fanks  but i don t  like girls   oh  master guy chelsea  how you snubbed me    the boy s broad shoulders shook with laughter  but he captured the hand still smoothing his hair  and  drawing it down to his lips  kissed it gently  back and palm  and then each finger    poor kind hearted  well meaning little girl   he said   but she must admit  little girls of seven are not always attractive to small boys of six     i was not seven   said the aunt  with portentous emphasis   leave go of my hand  boy  and listen  when you were six  i was sixteen    this bomb of the aunt s was received with a moment s respectful silence  as befitted the discharge of her principal field piece  then the boy s gay voice said    and what of that  dear  when i was six  you were sixteen  when i was twenty  you were twenty nine     thirty  boy  thirty  be accurate  and now you are twenty six  and i am getting on towards forty     thirty six  dear  thirty six  be accurate   pleaded the boy    and when you are forty  i shall be fifty  and when you are fifty  boy only fifty  a man is in his prime at fifty i shall be sixty     and when i am eighty   said the boy   you will be ninety an old lady is in her prime at ninety  what a charming old couple we shall be  i wonder if we shall still play tennis  i think quite the jolliest thing to do  when we are very very old quite decrepit  you know will be to stay at folkestone  and hire two bath chairs  with nice active old men to draw them  ancient  of course  but they would seem young compared to us  and then make them race on the leas  a five pound note to the winner  to insure them really galloping  we would start at the most crowded time  when the band was playing  and race in and out among lots of other bath chairs going slowly  and simply terrified at us  let s be sure and remember to do it  christobel  sixty years from to day  have you a pocket book  i shall be a gay young person of eighty six  and you     boy dear   she said  bending over him  with a catch in her voice   you must be serious and listen  when i have said that which i must say  you will understand directly that it is no use having your seven days  it will be better and wiser to raise the siege at once  and march away  listen      hush  stay perfectly still  no  i can say what i am going to say more easily if you don t  look at me     please  boy  please     i told you my  little boy blue stories  to make you realize how very much older i am than you  i was practically grown up  when you were still a dear delightful baby  i could have picked you up in my arms and carried you about  oh  cannot you see that  however much i loved him perhaps i should rather say  just because i love him  because i have always wanted to help him carry his heavy stones  make the best of his life  and accomplish manfully the tasks he sets himself to do i could not possibly marry my little boy blue  i could not  oh i could not  let him tie his youth and brightness to a woman  staid and middle aged  who might almost be his mother    the earnest  anxious voice  eager in its determined insistence  ceased   the boy sat very still  his head bent forward  his brown hands clasping his knees  then suddenly he knelt up beside her  leaned over the arm of her chair  and looked into her eyes  there was in his face such a tender reverence of adoration  that the aunt knew she need not be afraid to have him so near  this was holy ground  she put from off her feet the shoes of doubt and distrust  waiting  in perfect calmness  to hear what he had to say    dear   murmured the boy  tenderly   your little stories might possibly have had the effect you intended specially the place where you paused and gazed at me as if you saw me still with sand upon my nose  and ten pink toes like sea shells  that was calculated to make any chap feel youngish  and a bit shy  wasn t  it  yes  they might have told the way you meant  were it not for one dear sentence which overshadows all the rest  you said just now   i knew my little boy blue had no mother  i wanted to take him in my arms  smooth his curls  and comfort him   christobel  that dear wish of yours was a gift you then gave to your little boy blue  you can t  take it away now  because he has grown bigger  he still has no mother  no sisters  no near relations in the world  that all holds good  can you refuse him the haven  the help  the comfort you would have given him then  now when at last he is old enough to know and understand  to turn to them  in grateful worship and wonder  would you have me marry a girl as feather brained  as harum scarum  as silly as i often am myself  you suggest mollie  but the boy blue of to day agrees with his small wise self of twenty years ago and says   fanks  but i don t  like girls   oh  christobel  i want a woman s love  a woman s arms  a woman s understanding tenderness  you said  just now  you wished you had been my mother  does not the love of the sort of wife a fellow really wants  have a lot of the mother in it too  i ve  been filled with such a glory  christobel  since you admitted what you felt for your little boy blue because i seemed to know  somehow  that having once felt it  though the feeling may have gone to sleep  you could never put it quite away  but  if your little boy blue came back  from the other end of the world  and wanted you    the boy stopped suddenly  struck dumb by the look on the beautiful face beneath his  he saw it pale to absolute whiteness  while the dear firm lips faltered and trembled  he saw the startled pain leap into the eyes  he did not understand the cause of her emotion  or know that he had wakened in that strongly repressed nature the desperate hunger for motherhood  possible only to woman at the finest and best   she realized now why she had never forgotten her little boy blue of the dovercourt sands  he  in his baby beauty and sweetness  had wakened the embryo mother in the warm hearted girl of sixteen  and now he had come back  in the full strength of his young manhood  overflowing with passionate ideality and romance  to teach the lonely woman of thirty six the true sweet meaning of love and of wifehood   her heart seemed to turn to marble and cease beating  she felt helpless in her pain  only the touch of her little boy blue  or of baby boy blues so like him  that they must have come trotting down the sands of life straight from the heaven of his love and hers  could ever still this ache at her bosom   she looked helplessly up into his longing  glowing  boyish face so sweet  so young  so beautiful   should she put up her arms and draw it to her breast   she had given no actual promise to the professor  she had not mentioned him to the boy   ah  dear god  if one had waited twelve long years for a thing which was to prove but an empty husk after all  in order not to fail the possible expectations of another  had she any right to lay such a heavy burden of disappointment upon her little boy blue  and  if she must do so  how could she best help him to bear it    fanks   came a brave little voice  with almost startling distinctness  across the shore of memory   fanks  but i always does my own cawwying    at last she found her voice    boy dear   she said  gently   please go now  i am tired    then she shut her eyes   in a few seconds she heard the gate close  and knew the garden was empty   tears slipped from between the closed lids  and coursed slowly down her cheeks  the only right way is apt to be a way of such pain at the moment  that even those souls possessing clearest vision and endowed with strongest faith  are unable to hear the golden clarion call  sounding amid the din of present conflict   through much tribulation  enter into the kingdom    thus hopeless tears fell in the old garden   and martha  the elderly housekeeper  faithful but curious  let fall the lath of the green venetian blind covering the storeroom window  through which she had permitted herself to peep  as the postern gate closed on the erect figure of the boy  she dropped the blind and turned away  an unwonted tear running down the furrows of her hard old face    lord love  im   she said   he ll get what he wants in time  there s not a woman walks this earth as couldn t  never refuse  im nothing    with which startling array of negatives  old martha compiled one supreme positive in favour of the boy  leaving altogether out of account alas  the professor   then she wiped her eyes with her apron  and chid her nose harshly for an unexpected display of sentiment   and the boy tramped back to his hotel with his soul full of glory  knowing his first march round had been to some purpose  the walls of the beloved citadel had trembled indeed    and the evening and the morning were the first day       the second day  miss charteris takes control  the boy arrived in flannels  his racket under his arm  he came in  as usual  through the little green gate in the red brick fruit wall at the bottom of the garden  from the first  he had taken this privilege  which as a matter of fact had never been accorded to anybody   the professor always entered by the front door  placed his umbrella in the stand  wet or shine  left his goloshes on the mat  hung up his cap and gown  and followed jenkins into the drawing room  though he had called regularly  twice a week  during the last dozen years first on his old friend and tutor  professor charteris  after his death  on his widow and daughter  and  when miss charteris was left alone  on herself only he never failed to knock and ring  nor did he ever enter unannounced   the boy had dashed in at the garden gate on the occasion of his second visit  and appeared to consider that he had thus created a precedent which should always be followed   once  and once only on her thirtieth birthday the professor had brought miss charteris a bouquet  but  being very absent minded  he deposited the bouquet on the mat  and advanced into the drawing room carrying his goloshes in his left hand  having shaken hands with his right  he vaguely presented the goloshes  miss charteris  never at a loss where her friends were concerned  took the professor s goloshes from his hand  carried them out into the hall  found the bouquet on the mat  and saved the situation by putting the flowers in water  and thanking the professor with somewhat more hilarity than the ordinary presentation of a bouquet would have called forth   but to return to the second day  the boy arrived in flannels  and tea was a merry meal  the boy wanted particulars concerning the marriage  which had taken place a year or so before  between martha maid of thirty years  standing  now acting as cook housekeeper to miss charteris and jenkins  the butler  the boy wanted to know which proposed  jenkins or martha  in what terms they announced the fact of their engagement  to miss charteris  whether jenkins ever  bucked up and looked like a bridegroom   and whether martha wore orange blossom and a wedding veil  he extorted the admission that christobel had been present at the wedding  and insisted on a detailed account  over which  when given at last  he slapped his knee so often  and went into such peals of laughter  that miss charteris glanced anxiously towards the kitchen and pantry windows  which unfortunately looked out on the garden   the boy expatiated on his enthusiastic admiration for martha  but at the same time was jolly well certain he would have bolted when it came to  i  martha  take thee  jenkins   had he stood in the latter s shoes  miss charteris did not dare admit  that as a matter of fact the sentence had been   i  martha  take thee  noah   that the meek jenkins should possess so historical and patriarchal a name  would completely have finished the boy  who was already taking considerable risks by combining much laughter with an unusually large number of explosive buns   the boy would have it  that  excepting in the r le of bride and subsequent conjugal owner and disciplinarian  martha was perfect   miss charteris admitted martha s unrivalled excellence as a cook  her economy in management  and fidelity of heart  but martha had a temper  also  though undoubtedly a superficial fault  yet trying to the artistic eye of miss charteris  martha s hair was apt to be dishevelled and untidy    it is a bit wispy   admitted the boy  reluctantly   why don t  you tell her so    miss charteris smiled   boy dear  i daren t   it would be as much as my place is worth  to make a personal observation to martha     i ll tell her for you  if you like   said the boy  coolly    if you do   warned miss charteris   it will be the very last remark you will ever make in martha s kitchen  boy     oh  there are ways of telling   said the boy  airily  and pinched an explosive bun   after tea they took their rackets and strolled down the lawn  pausing a moment while she chose him a buttonhole  the tie was orange on this second day  and she gathered the opening bud of a william allen richardson rose  she smiled into its golden heart as she pinned it in his white flannel coat  somehow it brought a flash of remembrance of the golden heart of little boy blue  who could not bear that any one should be past praying for  or that even a scarecrow should seem lonely   they crossed the lane and entered the paddock  tightened the net on the tennis court  chose out half a dozen brand new balls  and settled down to fast and furious singles   miss charteris played as well as she had ever played in her life  but the boy was off his service  and she beat him six to four  next time  he pulled off  games all   but lost the set  then was beaten  three to six   miss charteris was glowing with the exercise  and the consciousness of being in great form    boy dear   she called  as she played the winning stroke of the third set   i m afraid you re lazy to day    the boy walked up to the net  and looked at her through his racket    i m not lazy   he said   but i m on the wrong side of jordan  this sort of thing is waste of time  i want to go over  and start marching     don t  be absurd  boy  i prefer this side jordan  thank you  and you shall stay here until you beat me    the boy won the next set   it was deliciously cool and quiet under the mulberry tree   the boy was quite subdued for him  he seemed inclined to do his marching in silence  on this second day   miss charteris felt her mental balance restored  she held the reins to day  and began considering how to deal wisely with the boy  so much depended upon how she managed him   at length she said   boy  when you were at trinity  i often used to see you  i knew you were my little boy blue of all those years ago  i used to feel inclined to send for you  talk to you for your good  and urge you to set to  and do great things  but i remembered the stone  and the bucket  and i did not want to let myself in for a third snubbing    the boy smiled   did you think me a lazy beggar   he asked   i wasn t  really  you know  i did quite a good deal of all kinds of things  but i didn t  want to get played out  i wanted to do things all the rest of my life  fellows who grind at college and come out senior wranglers  begin and end there  you don t  hear of  em again     i see   said miss charteris  amusement in her eyes   so you felt it wisest to avoid being senior wrangler     just so   said the boy   i was content with a fairly respectable b a  and i hope you saw me take it  how rotten it is  going up in a bunch  all hanging on to an old chap s fingers     boy  boy  i know all about you  you wasted golden opportunities  you declined to use your excellent abilities  you gave the authorities an anxious time  you were so disgracefully popular  that everybody thought your example the finest thing to follow  and you were more or less responsible for every lark and row which took place during your time    the boy did not smile  he looked at her  with a quaint  innocent seriousness  which made her feel almost uncomfortable    dear   he said   i had plenty of money  and heaps of friends  and i wanted to have a good time  also i wanted all the other fellows to have a good time  and i enjoyed getting the better of all the old fogies who had forgotten what youth was like if they d ever known it  and i had no mother to ask me questions  and no sisters to turn up at my rooms unexpectedly  but i can tell you this  christobel  i hope to be married soon  and i hope to marry a woman so sweet and noble and pure  that her very presence tests a man s every thought  feeling  and memory  and i can honestly look into your dear eyes and say  my wife will be welcome to know every detail of every prank i ever played in cambridge  nor is there a thing in those three years i need feel ashamed of her knowing  there  will that do    miss charteris threw out a deprecatory hand   oh  boy dear   she said   i never doubted that  my little boy blue  don t  i know you  but i cannot let you talk as if you owe me any explanations  how curious to think i saw you so often during those years  yet we never actually met    the boy smiled   yes   he said   we were all awfully proud of you  you know  what was it you took at girton    miss charteris mentioned  modestly  the highest honours in classics as yet taken by a woman  the boy had often heard it before  but he listened with bated breath    yes   he said   we were awfully proud of it  because of your tennis  and because of you being well  just you  if you had been a round shouldered little person in a placket  we should have taken it differently  we always called you  the goddess   because of your splendid walk  did you know     no  boy  i did not know  but i confess to feeling immensely flattered  only  take a friend s advice  and avoid conversational allusions to plackets  because you are obviously ignorant of the meaning of the word  and now  tell me  having successfully escaped so serious a drawback to future greatness as becoming senior wrangler  on what definite enterprise have you embarked     flying   said the boy  sitting forward in his chair   i am going to break every record  i am going to fly higher  farther  faster  than any man has ever flown before  this week  if i had not stayed on here you know originally i came up only for the  may week  i was to have done a channel flight  ah  you don t  know what it means  to own three flying machines  all of different make  and each the best of its kind  you feel you own the world  and then to climb into your seat and go whirling away  with the wonderful hum in your ears  mastering the air the hitherto invincible air  may i tell you what i am going to do for my next fly  start from the high ground between dover and folkestone  fly over the channel  circle round boulogne cathedral you remember the high dome  rising out of the old town surrounded by the ramparts  then back across the channel  and to ground again at folkestone  all in one flight  and i hope to do it in record time  if winds are right     and if winds are wrong  boy  if you rush out and take the horrid risks of the cross currents you told us about  if something happens to your propeller  and you fall headlong into the sea     oh  it s all u p then   said the boy  lightly   but one never expects that sort of thing to happen  and when it does  all is over so quickly that there is no time for anticipation  beside  there must be pioneers  every good life given  advances the cause    christobel charteris looked at him  his was not the terrible  unmistakable  relentless face of the bird man  he was brilliant with enthusiasm  but it was the enthusiasm of the sportsman  keen to excel  of young england  dauntless  fearless  eager to break records  the spirit of the true bird man had not  as yet  entered into her little boy blue   she pressed her hand upon her bosom  it ached still    boy dear   she said  softly   has it ever struck you that  if you marry  your wife whoever she might be would most probably want you to give up flying  i cannot imagine a woman being able to bear that a man who was her all  should do these things    the boy never turned a hair  he did not bound in his seat  he did not even look at her    why  of course  dear   he said   if you wished it  i should give up flying  like a shot  and sell my aeroplanes  i know plenty of chaps who would like to buy them to morrow  and i ll tell you what we would do  we d buy the biggest  most powerful motor car we could get  and we d tear all over the country  exceeding the speed limit  and doing everything jolly we could think of  that would be every bit as good as flying  if if we did it together  i say  christobel do you know how to make a sentence of  together   just three words  to get her  that s what  together  spells for me now    miss charteris smiled   you might have taken honours in spelling  boy  and i am not the sort of person who enjoys exceeding speed limits  also i am afraid i have a troublesome habit of always wanting to stop and see all there is to see    but the boy was infinitely accommodating   oh  we wouldn t  exceed the speed limit much  and we would stop everywhere  and see everything  you should breakfast in london  lunch at the old white horse  mr  pickwick s inn at ipswich  have tea at the maid s head  beneath the shadow of norwich cathedral  where you could wash your hands in queen elizabeth s fusty old bedroom what a lot of bedrooms queen elizabeth slept in  and made them all fusty and have time to show me little boy blue s breakwater at dovercourt  before dinner  there s nothing like motoring     it sounds interesting  certainly   said miss charteris    and then   continued the boy  in a calm business like voice   it s less expensive than flying  you run through fifty thousand a year in no time with aeroplanes  and of course we should want to open both my places  i m awfully glad i didn t  let the tenants in the old home renew their lease  as it is  they turn out in three months  oh  i say  christobel  i do believe it is a setting worthy of you  have you ever seen it  the great hall  the old pictures  the oak staircase i once rode down it on my rocking horse and came to utter smash  and outside the park  the lake  the beech avenue  the rose garden  the peacocks  and a funny little old village belongs to us  think how the people must want looking after  i believe you would like it all i really believe you would  and think  ah  just think what it would be to me  to see my own splendid wife  queen over everything in my dear jolly old home  hullo  hark to all the clocks  what is that striking  seven  oh  i say  i m dining with the master to night  i must rush off  and change  though i was such a bad lot  they all seem quite pleased to see me again  really they do  have i stayed too long      sure      may i come to morrow      you are most awfully good to me  good bye    and the boy was gone  he had held her hand  in a firm  strong clasp  a second longer than the conventional handshake  his clear eyes  exactly on a level with hers  had looked at her gravely  wistfully  tenderly  and he was gone   she walked slowly up the lawn  she must write a few letters before post time  then dress for her solitary dinner   she felt a little flat  quite without cause  what could have been more satisfactory  in every way  than the boy s visit  in spite of his absurd castles in the air  these must be tactfully demolished to morrow  to day  it was wisest just to let him talk   poor little boy blue  instead of the walls of jericho falling  his own castles in the air would come tumbling about his ears  poor little boy blue   she felt she had been completely mistress of the situation to day  holding it exactly as she wished it to be  there was no need to fear the remaining days   and when the seven days were over what then      she certainly felt very flat this evening  how suddenly the boy had gone  there was still so much she wanted to say to him     and to morrow was the professor s afternoon  mercifully  he never stayed later than four o clock  it was to be hoped the boy would not turn up early  but there was never any knowing what the boy would do   she smiled as she mounted the flight of stone steps  and passed into the house   and  outside the postern gate  the boy threw up his cap  and caught it  then started off and sprinted a hundred yards  then  turning aside  leapt a five barred gate  and made off across the fields  when he pulled up at last  in his own bedroom  he had just time to tub  shave  and wrestle with his evening clothes  he communed with himself in the few moments of enforced stillness  while he mastered his tie    that was all right   he said   i jolly well worked that all right  there was nothing to frighten her to day not a thing  dear lips  they never trembled once  and no more turning faint  and  my goody  how she lectured me  i wonder who s been telling her what  i know why she did it too  she wanted to feel quite sure she was bossing the show  and so she was  bless her  but i marched round  yes  i jolly well marched round     oh  i say  can t  you stop where i put you   this  to his tie   then  with her golden rose in his button hole  fastened by the pin from his flannel coat  off went the boy to dine with the master of his college    and the evening and the morning were the second day       the third day  the boy invades the kitchen  the boy sat on a corner of the kitchen table  swinging a loose leg  and watching martha make hot buttered toast   he had arrived early  and  finding no one in the garden  had entered the house by the garden door  to pursue investigations upstairs   on the mat in the hall he saw a pair of goloshes  in the umbrella stand  a very large  badly rolled umbrella  hanging on a peg near by  a professor s cap and gown   the boy stood stock still in the middle of the little hall  and looked at the goloshes   then from the drawing room  through the closed door  came the voice of miss charteris full  clear  measured  melodious reading greek tragedy    rrois anaid s   n t chei nean a declaimed miss charteris  and the boy fled   arrived in the kitchen  he persuaded martha that cigarette smoke was fatal to black beetles  he went about  blowing fragrant clouds into every possible crack and cranny  martha watched him  out of the corner of her eye  crawling along under the dresser in his immaculate white flannels  and martha blessed her stars that her kitchen floor was so spotlessly clean  only this morning she had remarked to jenkins that he could very well eat his dinner off the boards  mercifully  jenkins tiresome man though he usually was had not taken this literally  or he might have made the floor less fit for the boy s perambulations   having taken all this trouble in order to establish his unquestioned right to smoke in martha s kitchen  and to pose as a public benefactor while so doing  the boy seated himself on the edge of the table  exactly behind martha  lighted a fresh  zenith   and prepared to enjoy himself   martha glanced nervously at the smoke  issuing from cracks and holes on all sides  it gave her a feeling that the house was on fire  of course she knew it was not  but to feel the house is on fire  is only one degree less alarming than to know it is  however  beetles are nasty things  and the condescending kindness and regard for martha s personal comfort  which crawled about after them in white flannels  was gratifying to a degree   so martha turned and gave the boy one of her unusual smiles  he was very intently blowing rings  bubbles  martha called them afterwards  when explaining them to jenkins  but that was martha s mistake  they were smoke rings  it was one of the boy s special accomplishments  he was an expert at blowing rings   presently   martha  my duck   he said suddenly   martha jumped   bless us  mr  guy  what a name     what s the matter with it   inquired the boy  innocently   i consider it a very nice name  and scriptural     oh  i didn t  mean m  own name   explained martha  more flushed than the warmth of the fire warranted   not but what m  godfathers and godmothers might well  ave chosen me a better     oh  don t  blame them  overmuch  martha   said the boy  earnestly   you see their choice was limited  if you study your catechism you will find that it had to be  n  or  m   naomi  or  martha   even at that early age  they thought you favoured  martha  rather than  naomi   so they named you  martha      well i never   exclaimed mrs  jenkins    n  or  m   so it is  now i never noticed that before  we live and learn  and jenkins silly man  as always bin annoyed that they named  im  noah   but how about when you was christened  mr  guy     oh   explained the boy  with a wave of his cigarette   i was christened a bit later than you  martha  and  by that time  parliament had sat in solemn convocation  and had brought in a bill to the effect that all needless and vexatious limitations and restrictions in the prayer book might for the future be disregarded  the first to go was  n  or  m      well  i never   said martha   i wish they d ha  done it afore my time     you see   expounded the boy  who was enjoying himself vastly  and getting the conjunction of the goloshes and the greek play off his mind   you see  martha  those progressive bills  intimately affecting the whole community  of vital importance to the nation at large  are always blocked by the house of lords  if the commons could have had their own way  you might have been named  lucy  or  clara      i don t  incline to  lucy  or  clara   sir   said mrs  jenkins  decidedly   being  as they always strikes me  sickly story book sort of names  but i do like justice and a free country  i always have felt doubtful o  them lords  since i listened to my married niece s husband  a very respectable journeyman tailor but mostly out of work  and if it s their doing that i m  martha   well  i shall know what to do with jenkins s vote that s all    the boy slapped his leg and rocked   martha  you ought to be put up to speak at political meetings  that s the whole thing in a nutshell  cause  effect  results  arguments  everything  oh  my wig  yes  they are a lot of old stick in the muds in the upper house  aren t  they   pursued the boy who had had a long line of dignified ancestors in that much abused place  had an uncle there at the present moment  and was more than likely eventually to have to sit there himself  a rotten lot of old stick in the muds  martha  but i think they did well by you  i d give them the benefit of jenkins s vote  i really would  i am glad they chose  m   not  n   naomi was a widow and dismal  she never made the smallest effort to buck up  but martha was a nice person  a bit flurried perhaps  and hot tempered  but well up in cooking  and keen on it  i like martha    the boy sat and meditated  why did she read greek plays with a person who left goloshes on the mat  and brought out an ancient umbrella with a waist  on an absolutely cloudless day    it wasn t  m  own name surprised me  mr  guy  sir   remarked martha  coyly   it was the name you was pleased to hadd    the boy pulled himself together   eh  what  oh   martha  my duck   i see  i hope you don t  mind  martha  it seemed to me rather a suitable and pretty addition to  martha   you see  yours is a name which cannot be shortened when one feels affectionate   sarah  can be  sally    amelia  can be  milly    caroline  can be  carrie   but  martha  remains  martha  however loving people feel  what does jenkins call you when he feels affectionate    martha snorted   jenkins knows  is place   she said  jerking the round lid off the stove  and putting on the kettle    jenkins is a model   smiled the boy   then martha looked round  her feminine curiosity  and perhaps a touch of jealousy  getting the better of her respectful discretion  she had seen so much  and heard so little  and she was a very old family servant    what do you call her  mr  guy   she asked  in a confidential whisper  with a jerk of the head toward the mulberry tree    her   repeated the boy  surprised  then his whole tone softened  it was so sweet to speak her name to some one   i call her  christobel    he said  gently   but martha wanted to know more  martha was woman enough to desire an unshared possession of her own  she bent over the fire  stirring it through the bars    mr  guy  sir  i suppose you don t  i suppose you do that is to say  sir do you call her what you ve  been pleased to call me     eh  what   said the boy  vaguely    oh  i see   christobel  my   oh  no  martha  no  i don t   not even when i feel most affectionate   here the boy was seized with sudden convulsions  slapped his knee noiselessly  and rocked on the kitchen table  he whispered it  in an ecstasy of enjoyment    christobel  my duck   oh  lor   christobel  my duck   i hope i shall be able to resist telling her  i should have to own i had called martha so   christobel  my     martha  wondering at the silence  looked round suddenly  but the boy had that instant recovered  and was sitting gravely on the corner of the table    martha  my duck   he said   to return to the original opening of this conversation  has jenkins ever told you what a nice little wisp of hair you have  behind your left ear     get along  sir   retorted martha  fairly blushing   you re making game of me     indeed  i m not   said the boy  seriously   if you made it into a curl  martha  and fastened it with an invisible pin  it would be quite too fascinating  you ask jenkins  i say  martha  what s a placket     a placket  sir   said martha  on her way to fetch something from a shelf near which hung the kitchen mirror   a placket  sir  is a thing which shows when it shouldn t      i see   said the boy   then you couldn t  exactly go about in one  martha  whose goloshes are those  sitting on the mat in the hall    martha snorted   an old woman s   she said  wrathfully   the boy considered this   and does the umbrella with the waist belong to the same old woman    martha nodded    and the professor s cap and gown  hanging near by    martha hesitated    tain t  always petticoats makes an old woman   she said  sententiously    martha  you are pro foundly right   said the boy   does the professor stay to tea     thank goodness no  sir  we draw the line at that   cept when miss hann comes too     who is miss hann     she s the professor s sister   martha hesitated  poured hot water into the silver teapot  then turned to whisper confidentially  with concentrated dislike   she s always a hegging of  em on     what a curious occupation   remarked the boy  blowing a smoke ring   does miss hann come often     no  mr  guy  thanks be  she s a hinvalid     poor miss hann  what s the matter with her    martha snorted   fancies herself too much     what a curious complaint  what are the symptoms     fancies herself in a bath chair   said martha  scornfully    i see   said the boy   oh  poor miss hann  i should feel very sick if i fancied myself in a bath chair  i wish i could meet miss hann  i should like to talk to her about the hegging on business     you d make her sit up   said martha  with spiteful enjoyment    oh no  i shouldn t    said the boy   that would not be kind to an invalid  i should see that she reclined  comfortably  and then i should jolly well flatten her out    at that moment a shadow fell across the sunny window  miss charteris  her guest having departed  passed down the garden steps  and moved across the lawn   the boy sprang to his feet  at sight of her  his conscience smote him that he should have thus gossiped and chaffed with old martha  he suddenly remembered why he had originally found his way to the kitchen    martha   he said   i want you to let me carry out the tea tray this afternoon  she doesn t  know i am here  she will think it is you or jenkins  till she looks round  let me carry it out  martha  there s a duck     as you please  sir   said martha   but if you want her to think it s jenkins  you must put it down with a clatter  it takes a man to be clumsy    the boy walked over to the window  the mulberry tree was not visible from the kitchen table    don t  go there  mr  guy   cried martha   miss christobel will see you  sir  this window  and the pantry  show from the garden  if you want to  ave a look at her  go through that door into the storeroom  the venetian blind is always down in there  there is one crack through which i    martha stopped short  disconcerted    one crack through which you think i could see  thank you  martha   said the boy  readily   hurry up with the tray    he went into the store room  found martha s chink  and realized exactly what had been the extent of martha s view  during the last two days   then he bent his hungry young eyes on christobel   she was seated in a garden chair  her back to the house  her face towards the postern gate in the old red wall at the bottom of the garden  the rustic table  upon which he would soon deposit the tea tray  was slightly behind and to the left of her  the sun shone through the mulberry leaves  glinting on the pure whiteness of her gown  she leaned her beautiful head back wearily  her whole attitude betokened fatigue  he could not see her face  but he felt sure her eyes were open  and he knew her eyes were on the gate   the boy s lips moved   christobel   he whispered   christobel beloved    she was waiting  and he knew she was waiting for him   presently he dropped the lath of the venetian blind  and turned to go  but first he took out his pocket book and fastened the lath which lifted most easily  to those above and below it  with halfpenny stamps  he knew old martha would take a hint from him  there must be no eyes on the mulberry tree to day   in the kitchen the tray was ready  tea freshly made  thin bread and butter  cucumber sandwiches  hot buttered toast in perfection  cornflour buns  warranted to explode  all the things he liked most  and  best of all  cups for two  he grasped the tray firmly with both hands    martha   he said   you are a jewel  i give you leave to watch me down the lawn from the kitchen window  but when i have safely arrived  turn your attention to your own tea  or i shall look up and shake my fist at your dear nice old face  and  i say  martha  do you ever write postcards  because  if you want any ha penny stamps  you will find some on the storeroom blind  only  don t  want them  martha  till this week is over  and i am gone    whereupon the boy lifted the tray  and made for the door   down the lawn he bore it  and set it safely on the rustic table  he was very deft of movement  was the boy  yet  remembering his instructions  he contrived to set it down with something of a clatter   miss charteris did not turn her head her eyes  half closed beneath the long lashes  were on the postern gate    jenkins   she said    yes  ma am   replied the boy  in excellent imitation of the meek tones of jenkins    should any one call this afternoon  jenkins  please remember that i am not  at home      hip  hip  hurrah   said the boy   then she turned and her face was all  and more than all  he had hoped it might be    oh  boy   she said   oh  boy dear    after that  it was a very happy tea  neither had been quite natural  nor had they been really true to themselves  the day before  so the delight of meeting seemed to follow a longer parting than the actual twenty four hours  the boy s brown eyes rested in tenderness on the hand that filled his cup  and she did not say  don t    she merely smiled indulgently  and added the cream and sugar slowly  as if to let him do what he willed   the hum of bees was in the garden  a sense of youth was in the air  the sunbeams danced among the mulberry leaves   the boy insisted upon carrying back the tray  to do away at once with the possibility of interruption from jenkins  then he drew their chairs into the deeper shade of the mulberry tree  a corner invisible from all windows  the boy had learned a lesson while looking through the storeroom blind   there they sat and talked  in calm content  it did not seem to matter much of what they spoke  so long as they could lie back facing one another  each listening to the voice which held so much more of meaning in it than the mere words it uttered  each looking into the eyes which had now become clear windows through which shone the soul   suddenly the boy said   how silly we were  the other day  to talk of the relative ages of our bodies  what do they matter  our souls are the real you and i  and our souls are always the same age  some souls are old old from the first  i have seen an old soul look out of the eyes of a little child  and i have seen a young soul dance in the eyes of an old  old woman  you and i  thank god  have young souls  christobel  and we shall be eternally young    he stretched his arms over his head  in utter joyful content with life    go on  boy dear   said christobel   i am not sure that i agree with you  but i like to hear you talk     at first   he said   our bodies are so babyish that our souls do not find them an adequate medium of expression  but by and by our bodies grow and develop  after which come the beautiful years of perfection  ten  twenty  thirty of them  when the young soul goes strong and gay through life  clad in the strong gay young body  then gradually  gradually  the strong young soul  in its unwearied  immortal youth  wears out the body  the body grows old  but not the soul  nothing can age that  and when at last the body quite wears out  the young soul breaks free  and begins again  youthful souls wear out their bodies quicker than old ones  just as a strong young boy romps through a suit of clothes sooner than a weakly old man  but there is always life more abundant  and a fuller life farther on  so the mating of souls is the all important thing  and when young souls meet and mate  what does it matter if there be a few years  difference in the ages of their bodies  their essential youthfulness will surmount all that    christobel looked at him  and truly for a moment the young soul in her leapt out to his  in glad response  then the other side of the question rose before her    ah  but  boy dear   she said   the souls express themselves their needs  their delights  their activities through the bodies  and suppose one body  in the soul union  is wearing out sooner than the other  that is hard on the other hard on both  boy my little boy blue shall i tell you an awful secret  i suppose i sat too closely over my books at girton  i suppose i was not sufficiently careful about good print  or good light  anyway boy dear i have to use glasses when i read   she looked wistfully into his bright eyes   you see  already i am beginning to grow old   her sweet lips trembled   in a moment he was kneeling by the arm of her chair  bending over her  as he did on the first day  but as he did not do yesterday  suddenly she realized why she had felt so flat yesterday  after he was gone   he lifted her hand and kissed it gently  back and palm  then he parted the third finger from the rest  with his own brown ones  and held that against his warm young lips   she drew her hand slowly away  passed it over his hair  then let it fall upon her lap  she could not speak  she could not move  she could not send him away  she wanted him so her little boy blue  of long ago    old  my beloved   he said   you old  never  always perfect perfect to me  and why not wear glasses  heaps of mere kids wear glasses  and wear them all the time  only how alarmingly clever you must look in spectacles  christobel  it would terrify me now  but by and by it will make me feel proud  i think one would expect glasses to go with those awe inspiring classical honours  with my barely respectable b a   i daren t  lay claim to any outward marks of erudition   then  as she did not smile  but still gazed up at him  wistfully  his look softened to still deeper tenderness   dear eyes   he murmured   oh dear  dear eyes   and gently laid his lips on each in turn    don t    she said  with a half sob   ah  boy  don t   you know you must not kiss me     kiss you   he said  still bending over her   do you call that kissing   then he laughed  and the joyous love in his laughter wrung her heart   christobel  on the seventh day  when the gates fly open  and the walls fall down  when the citadel surrenders  when you admit you are my own then i shall kiss you  then you will know what kissing really means    he bent above her  his lips were very near to hers  she closed her eyes and waited  her own lips trembled  she knew how fearfully it tempted the boy that her lips should tremble because his were near  yet she let them tremble  she forgot to remember the past  she forgot to consider the future  she was conscious of only one thing  that she wanted her little boy blue to teach her what kissing really meant  so she closed her eyes and waited   she did not hear him go  but presently she knew he was no longer there   she opened her eyes   the boy had walked across the lawn  and stood looking into the golden heart of an opening yellow rose  his back appeared very uncompromising  very determined  very erect   she rose and walked over to him  as she moved forward  with the graceful dignity of motion which was always hers  her mental balance returned   she slipped her hand beneath his arm   come  boy   she said   let us walk up and down  and talk  it is enervating to sit too long in the sunshine    he turned at once  suiting his step to hers  and they paced the lawn in silence   when they reached the postern gate the boy stood still  something in his look suddenly recalled her little boy blue  when the sand on his small nose could not detract from the dignity of his little face  nor weaken its stern decision   he took both her hands in his  and looked into her eyes    christobel   he said   i must go  i must go  because i dare not stay  you are so wonderful this afternoon  so dear beyond expression  i know you trust me absolutely  but this is only the third day  and i cannot trust myself  dear  so i m off    he lifted both her hands to his lips    may i go  my queen   he said    yes  boy   she answered   go    and he went   it was hard to hear the thud of the closing door  for some time she stood waiting  just on the inside  she thought he would come back  and she wished him to find her there  the moment he opened the door   but the boy being the boy did not come back   presently she returned to her chair  in the shade of the mulberry tree  she lay  with closed eyes  and lived again through the afternoon  from the moment when the boy had said   hip  hip  hurrah   there came a time when she turned very pale  and her lips trembled  as they had done before   at length she rose and paced slowly up the lawn  on her face was the quiet calm of an irrevocable decision    to morrow   she said   i must tell the boy about the professor    in the middle of the night  martha  being wakeful  became haunted by the remembrance of the smoke  as it had curled from cracks and keyholes in the kitchen  she felt constrained to put on a wonderful pink wrapper  and go creaking slowly down the stairs to make sure the house was not on fire  martha s wakefulness was partly caused by the unusual fact of a large and hard curl paper  behind her left ear   miss charteris was also awake  she was not worried by memories of smoke  or visions of fire  and her soft hair was completely innocent of curl papers  but she was considering how she should tell the boy about the professor  and that consideration was not conducive to calm slumber  she heard martha go creaking down the stairs  and  as martha came creaking up again  she opened her door  and confronted her    what are you doing  martha   she said   martha  intensely conscious of her curl paper  was about to answer with more than her usual respectful irritability  when the eyes of the two women mistress and maid met  in the light of their respective candles  and a sudden sense of fellowship in the cause of their night vigil passed between them   martha smiled a crooked smile  half ashamed to be seen smiling  when she spoke  her aspirates fell away from her more completely than in the daytime     e went crawlin  about the kitchen   she said  in a muffled midnight whisper   all in  is white flannels  puffin  smoke in every crack an   ole to kill the beetles  so kind  e meant it  but i couldn t  sleep for wonderin  if the place was smokin  still  i  ad to go down an  see   ow came you to be awake  miss christobel     things he said in the garden  martha  have given me food for thought  i began thinking them over  and sleep went    martha smiled again and this time the smile came more easily    e  as a way of keepin  one on the go   she said   but we d best be gittin  to sleep now  miss   e ll be at it again to morrow  bless  is  eart   and martha  in her pink wrapper  lumbered upwards   but the boy  who had this disturbing effect on the women who loved him  slept soundly himself  one arm flung high above his tumbled head  and if the sweet mother  who perforce had had to let her dying arms slip from about her baby boy  almost before his little feet could carry him across a room  saw from above the pure radiance on his lips and brow as he slept  she must have turned to the emerald throne with glad thanksgiving for the answer vouchsafed to a dead mother s prayers    and the evening and the morning were the third day       the fourth day  christobel signs her name   i am exhausted   said the boy  reaching out a long arm  and securing his third piece of hot buttered toast   i am ruffled  my usual calm mental poise is overthrown and on the sabbath  of all days  every feather i possess has been rubbed up the wrong way   he lay back in the depths of his chair  stretched out his legs  and looked dejectedly at christobel   her quiet smile enveloped him  her look was as a cool touch on a hot forehead    poor little boy blue  i thought something was wrong  i should feel a keener anxiety  were the hot buttered toast less obviously consoling     i ll jolly well never go again   said the boy  with indignation   not me     before you were born  boy  when i went to school   said miss charteris   we were taught to say  not i   and if you were to tell me where you have been  on this sabbath afternoon  i might be able to give you more intelligent sympathy     i ve  been to a drawing room meeting   said the boy   and i ve  heard a woman hold forth  for an hour and a quarter  i ve  sat stuffed up  breathing the atmosphere of other people s go to meeting clothes  and heard a good lady go meandering on  while i had no room for my legs     i thought you seemed finding them extra long  boy  why did you go to a drawing room meeting     i went   said the boy   because the dear old thing in whose house it was held asked me to go  she used to know my mother  when i was at trinity she looked me up  often invited me to her charming home  gave me excellent little dinners  followed by the kindest  nicest  most nervous little preachments  don t  look amused  dear  i never failed to profit  i respected her for it  she is as good and genuine as they make  em  and if she had stood up this afternoon  with her friendly smile  and dear shaky old voice  and given us an exposition of the twenty third psalm  we should have all come away quite  good and happy   instead of which oh  my wig    the boy took an explosive bun  and put it whole into his mouth   the only way to manage them on sunday   he explained  as soon as speech was possible   when sweeping is not the right thing  but let us hope mollie s papa s  clerical brethren  won t  find it out  there would certainly be less conversation and fewer crumbs  but no fun at all     i don t  think you need be afraid  boy dear  even should such a way out of the difficulty occur to them  i am inclined to think they would prefer the explosion  to the whole bun at a mouthful  it has a rather startling effect  you know  until one gets used to seeing it done  i can t  quite imagine an archdeacon doing it  while standing on the hearthrug in conversation with my brother  now tell me what the good lady said  which you found so trying     oh  she meandered on   grumbled the boy   she told us all we should have been  if we had not been what we were  and all we might be  if we were not what we are  and all we shall be  when we are not what we are  she implored us to consider  and weigh well  where we should go  if  by a sudden and unexpected dispensation of providence  we ceased to be where we then were  i jolly well knew the answer to that  for if providence had suddenly dispensated which it didn t   for a good three quarters of an hour i should have been here  here  here  as fast as my best sunday boots could carry me   his brown eyes softened   ah  think what  here  means   he said   think   here  means you    but miss charteris did not wish the conversation to become too meltingly personal    what else did she say  boy    he consulted the mulberry leaves  then bounded in his chair   ha  i have it  i kept this tit bit for you  she used an astronomical illustration  i haven t  the least idea apropos of what  but she told us exactly how many millions of miles the sun is from the earth  and then she smiled upon us blandly  and said   or is it billions   think of that  she said   or is it billions   in exactly the same tone of voice as she might have said of the bonnet she had on   i bought it  at a sale  for elevenpence three farthings  or was it a shilling      oh  boy  you really are naughty  i never connected you with personal sarcasm     yes  but that sort of woman shouldn t    complained the boy   and with half cambridge sitting listening   millions  or is it billions   oh lor     poor thing   remarked miss charteris   she could not have known that she had in the audience a person who had only just avoided the drawback to future enterprise  of being senior wrangler  had she realized that  she would have been more careful with her figures     tease away   said the boy   i don t  care  now i am safe here  only i shan t  tell you any more     i don t  want to hear any more  boy  i always enjoy appreciations  even of things i do not myself appreciate  but non appreciations do not appeal to me  if a person has meant to be effective and proved inadequate  or tried to do good and done harm  i would rather not know it  unless i can help to put matters right  have some more tea  boy  and then i want to talk to you myself  i have something rather special to tell you    the boy stood up and brought his cup to the little table  when she had filled it  he knelt on one knee beside her  his elbow on the arm of her chair  and drank his tea there    i am sorry  dear   he said  presently   i won t  do it again  perhaps i listened wrong  because i was bored at being there at all  i say  christobel it has just occurred to me did you know my mother    the old garden was very still  a hush  as of the paradise of god  seemed suddenly to fall upon it  as the boy asked his quiet question  a spirit seemed to hover  between them and the green dome of mulberry leaves above them  smoothing the boy s tumbled hair  and touching the noble brow of the woman the boy loved  a gentle  watching  thankful spirit eternally remembering  and tenderly glad to be remembered  for a few moments the silence was a silence which could not be broken  the boy lifted wondering eyes to the moving leaves  christobel laid her hand upon his  as it gripped her chair  an unseen voice seemed to whisper to the boy not in the stern tones of the church  but as an eager  anxious  question   wilt thou have this woman to be thy wedded wife   and silently the boy replied   please god  i will   and  bending  kissed the hand resting on his   the spell lifted  christobel spoke    yes  boy dear  i knew her  i have often wondered whether i might tell you  she and my mother were dear friends  i was thirteen when she died  you were three  poor little boy blue  two things i specially remember about your mother  the peculiar radiance of her face a light from within  shining out  and the fact that when she was in a room the whole atmosphere seemed rarefied  beautified  uplifted  i think she lived very near heaven  boy  and  like enoch  she walked straight in one day  and came back no more  she  was not   for god took her    another long holy silence  the mulberry leaves were still  then the boy said  softly   some day  will you tell me heaps more details lots of little things about her  no one ever has  but i seem almost to begin to remember her  when you talk of her  meanwhile  may i show you this    he drew from the inner pocket of his coat  a small well worn pocket bible  opening it at the fly leaf  he passed it to miss charteris    it was hers   he said   she bent over it and read the inscription   m  a  chelsea   through faith and patience inherit the promises    below  in a delicate writing  traced by a hand that trembled   to my baby boy from his mother   i have prayed for thee  that thy faith fail not    she looked at it in silence  how much had this book meant during all these years  to the  baby boy   had the book in his pocket  and the prayers hovering about him  something to do with the fact that he was still just little boy blue   the boy had taken a fountain pen from his pocket  and was shaking it vigorously over the grass   now he passed it to her    write your dear name beneath   he said   infinitely touched  she made no comment  raised no question  she took the pen  and wrote just  christobel     and the evening and the morning were the fourth day       the fifth day  guy chelsea takes control   now  sir boy   said miss charteris with decision   this is your fifth day  our time is nearly over  you have done most of the talking  you have had things entirely your own way  what      oh  well  almost entirely your own way  i have allowed you to play your old testament game to your heart s content  with commendable adaptability  i have been jericho  and you have marched round  i have been jericho in my own garden  and have refreshed the invading army with hot buttered toast and explosive buns  now it is my turn to take the initiative  jenkins having removed the tea  and it being too hot for tennis  i am going to ask you to sit still  while i explain to you quite clearly why i must send you away at the close of the seventh day    she tried to hide her extreme trepidation beneath a tone of gay banter  she hoped it did not sound as forced to him as it did to herself  the boy s clear eyes were fixed upon her  had he noticed the trembling of her hands  before she steadied them by laying hold of the arms of her chair    so now for a serious talk  if you please  sir boy     excuse me  dear   said the boy   the israelites were not allowed to parley     you need not parley   said miss charteris   you are requested merely to listen  you may smoke if you like  i understand cigarette smoke is fatal to black beetles  possibly it has the same effect on garden insects  russell tells me we are overrun by snails  smoke  boy  if you like     dear   said the boy  his head thrown back  his hands thrust deep into his coat pockets   i never have the smallest desire to smoke in your presence  i should feel as if i were smoking in church     oh  you dear amazing altogether absurd boy  don t  look at me like that  and don t  say such unexpected things  or i shall be unable to parley satisfactorily     when i went to school   remarked the boy   and you were an engaging little girl in a pigtail  i was taught to say   do not look at me thus   at least  masters frequently appeared to think it necessary to make that remark to me  i can t  imagine why  because they were not specially worth looking at  excepting that a very large person  in a very angry condition  always presented a spectacle of extreme interest to my juvenile mind  it was so fascinating to watch and see what they would do next  they were like those wooden monkeys and bears you buy in swiss shops  don t  you know  you pull a hanging string  and their legs and arms jump about unexpectedly  one always felt a really angry grown up was a mere puppet  unseen fingers were pulling the string  and it was funny to watch  there was an exciting element of danger  too  because sometimes a hand jerked up and boxed your ears     little boy blue   she said   it must have been quite impossible ever to be mildly angry with you  either one would have waxed impotently furious  or one would have wanted to to hug you    the boy leapt up    sit down   said miss charteris   or i shall send you away  and i do not wish to do that  because i have quite made up my mind to tell you to day  a thing which i suppose i ought to have told you long ago  and i tried to do so  boy  but somehow you always made it impossible  i want to to tell you about the professor   she paused   it was so very difficult  it was like rolling a heavy stone up a steep hill  and the boy made no attempt to help her  he lay back with an exaggerated display of resignation  he looked at her with sleepy  amused eyes  and he asked no questions  the army of israel obviously declined to parley    i have long felt i ought to tell you about the professor   continued miss charteris   the boy sighed   i think i jolly well know all there is to know about professors   he said    not about this one   explained miss charteris   he is my professor     oh  if he s your professor   said the boy  sitting up   of course i am interested  but i am not sure that i approve of you having a tame professor  especially when it arrives in goloshes  and leaves them in the hall     i am afraid nobody will ask whether you approve or not  little boy blue  the professor has been a great friend of mine during nearly twelve years  and i think i am possibly in fact  very probably going to marry the professor     really   said the boy   may i ask when he proposed     he has not proposed  boy    the boy produced his pocket book  took out a calendar  and studied it attentively    then i m afraid you will have some time to wait   he said   it will not be leap year again until         this sounded impertinent  but the boy could no more have been guilty of intentional impertinence toward her  than he could have picked her pocket  and miss charteris knew it  there was one thing of which those who had dealings with christobel charteris could always be sure absolute justice  she had seen the boy s face whiten suddenly  to a terrible pallor  beneath his tan  she knew he was making a desperate fight for self control  how best could she help  her own part seemed almost more than she could manage    come here  boy dear   she said  holding out her hand   he hesitated one instant  then rose unsteadily to his feet  and came not to his usual place at the side  bending over her  but in front of her  on one knee  silently waiting   she bent forward   take my hand  boy    he took it  in a firm unhesitating clasp  they held each other so  in silence  the colour came back into the boy s face  the dumb horror died out of his eyes  they smiled into hers again    now promise me  boy dear  that you will let me tell you all  and that you will try not to misunderstand     my dearest   said the boy   i promise  but i do not need to say i will try not to misunderstand  i could not misunderstand you  if i tried     then go back to your chair  boy    he went  his eyes were bright again    boy  please to understand that i am not engaged to the professor  of course  had that been the case  i should have told you  long ago  he has never said one word to me of love or marriage  but he has been a great friend an intimate friend  intellectually  and i have reason to know that he wishes has wished for years a good deal more than he has ever expressed to me  he has waited  boy  and when anybody has waited nearly twelve years  could one fail them     why  of course   cried the boy  eagerly   if a man could wait twelve years good heavens  why shouldn t  he wait twenty  a man has no business to wait  or to be able to wait  or to keep a woman waiting  twelve years  oh  i say  i didn t  wait twelve days  now  did i    she smiled   you break all speed records  boy  always  but cannot you understand that all men have not fifty thousand a year  and the world at their feet  had you been penniless  boy  you even you would have had to wait     not a bit   said the boy  stoutly   i would drive a cab  i would sweep a crossing  i would do anything  or be anything  but i wouldn t  wait for the woman i loved  nor would i  his voice dropped almost to a whisper  keep the woman who loved me  waiting     but suppose she had a comfortable little income of her own  and you had less much less to offer her  surely  boy  proper pride would keep you from asking her to marry you  until your income at least equalled hers     not a bit   said the boy   that sort of rot isn t  proper pride  it s just selfish false pride  however much a woman had  when a man a man  mind you  not an old woman  or a thing with no pluck or vertebra when a man gives a woman his whole love  his whole life  the worship of his whole body  heart  and soul  he has given her that which no money could buy  and were she a millionairess she would still be poor if  from false pride  he robbed her of that gift which was his to give her and perhaps his alone     boy dear   she said  gently   it sounds very plausible  but it is so easy to be plausible with fifty thousand a year in the background  let me tell you about the professor  he has  of course  his fellowship  and is quite comfortably off now  living as a bachelor  in rooms  but he practically supports his unmarried sister  considerably older than himself  who lives in a tiny little villa  and keeps one maid  the professor could not afford to marry  and set up a larger establishment  on his present income  at least he apparently thinks he could not  and your theory of robbing the woman who the woman he loves  does not appear to have occurred to him  but  during all these years he has been compiling an encyclopedia i don t  suppose you know what an encyclopedia is  boy     oh  don t  i   said the boy   it s a thing you pile up on the floor to stand upon when you want to fix a new pipe rack    miss charteris ignored this trying definition of an encyclopedia    the professor is compiling a wonderful book   she said  with dignity   and  when it is completed and published  he will be in a position to marry     has he told you so   inquired the boy    no  boy  he has never mentioned the subject of marriage to me  but he has told his sister  and she has told me     ha   said the boy   miss hann  i suppose  i must say  i distrust miss hann     what do you know of miss ann   inquired christobel  astonished    only that she s always a hegging of  em on   said the boy  calmly   the indignant blood rushed into the fair proud face    boy  you ve  been gossiping with martha     i have  dear  i admit it  you see  i arrived early  on the third day  found the garden empty  went gaily into the house to look for you  ran up into the hall  when up got a pair of old goloshes eh  what  oh  sorry up got a pair of new goloshes  and hit me in the eye  a professor s cap and gown hung up  as if at home  and while i meditated upon these things  the voice of my beloved was uplifted in loud and sonorous greek  exclaiming   avaunt  rash youth  thou impudent intruder   can you wonder that i avaunted to martha     you will please tell me at once all martha said to you     of course i will  dear  don t  be vexed  i always meant to tell you  some time or other  i asked her whose were the goloshes  the umbrella with the er decided figure  the suspended cap and gown  martha said they were the professor s  i inquired whether the professor stayed to tea  you really can t  blame me for asking that  because i had gone to the kitchen for the express purpose of carrying out the tea tray  yours and mine  but not the professor s  no possible pleasure could have resulted  either to you  or to me  or to the professor  from my unexpected appearance with the tea tray  if the professor had been there  now could it  i think it would be nice of you  dear  and only fair  if  remembering the peculiar circumstances of that afternoon  you just said   no  it couldn t      well  i asked martha whether the professor stayed to tea  and heard that  thank goodness  no   we drew the line at that  except when miss hann came too  with the awful possibility of miss hann  coming too   on one of my priceless days  i naturally desired a little light thrown on miss hann  i was considerably relieved to learn that miss hann suffers from the peculiar complaint mental  i gather of  fancying herself in a bath chair   this might be no hindrance to the  hegging on  propensities  but it certainly diminished the chances of the  coming too   that was all  dear     boy  you ought to have been ashamed of yourself     so i was  the moment i saw you walk down the lawn  but you really needn t  look so indignant  i was working for you  at the same time     working for me     yes  dear  i told martha her wisps would look nicer if she curled them  i also suggested  invisible pins   if you like i will tell you how i came to know about  invisible pins   but it is a very long story  and not specially interesting  for the lady in the case was my great aunt     oh  boy   said miss charteris  laughing in spite of herself   i wish you were the size of my little boy blue on the sands at dovercourt  i would dearly like to shake you     well   he said   you did more than shake me  just now  you gave me about the worst five minutes i ever had in my life  christobel  you don t  really care about the professor     boy  dear  i really do  i have cared about him very much  for years     yes  as a woman loves a book  but not as a woman loves a man     explain your meaning  please     oh  hang it all   exclaimed the boy  violently   do you love his mouth  his eyes  his hair    the boy choked  and stopped short   miss charteris considered  and replied with careful deliberation   i do not know that i have ever seen his mouth  he wears a beard  his eyes are not strong  but they look very kind through his glasses  his hair  well  really  he has not much to speak of  but all these things matter very little  his mind is great and beautiful  his thoughts appeal to me  i understand his way of viewing things  he understands mine  it would be a wonderful privilege to be able to make life easy and happy for one for whom i have so profound a respect and esteem  i have looked upon it  during the last few years  as a privilege which is  eventually  to be mine     christobel   cried the boy   it is wrong  it is terrible  it is not the highest  i can t  stand it  and i won t   i will not let you give yourself to a wizened old bookworm     be quiet  boy   she said  sharply   do you wish to make me really angry  the professor is not old  he is only fourteen years my senior  to your extreme youth  fifty may seem old  the professor is in his prime  i am afraid we have nothing to gain  boy  by prolonging this discussion     but we can t  leave it at this   said the boy  desperately   where do i come in     my little boy blue  i am afraid you don t  come in at all  excepting as a very sweet idyll which  all through the years to come  i shall never forget  you begged for your seven days  and i gave them  but i never led you to assume i could say  yes   now listen  boy  and i will tell you the honest truth  i do not know that i am ever going to marry the professor  i only feel pledged to him from the vague belief that we each consider the other is waiting  don t  break your heart over it  boy  because it is more than likely it will never come to pass  but even were there no professor oh  boy dear  i could not marry you  i love my little boy blue more tenderly and deeply than i have ever before loved anything or any one on this earth  but i could not marry a boy  however dearly i loved him  however sweet was his love to me  i am a woman grown  and i could surrender myself wholly  only to a man who would wholly be my mate and master  i cannot pretend to call my little boy blue  the man i love   because he is really dearest to me when i think of him  with expectation in his baby eyes  trotting down the sands to find his cannon ball     oh  boy  i am hurting you  i hate to hurt you  boy  your love is so beautiful  nothing as perfect will ever touch my life again  yet i cannot  honestly  give what you ask     boy dear  ought i to have told you  quite plainly  sooner  if so  you must forgive me    the boy had risen  and stood before her   you always do the right thing   he said   and never  under any circumstances  could there be anything for me to forgive you  i have been an egregious young ass  i have taken things for granted  all along the line  what must you think of me  why should you care  you  with your intellectual attainments  your honours  your high standing in the world of books  why should you care  christobel  why should you care    he stood before her  straight and tall and desperately implacable  the exuberant youth had died out of his face  for the first time  she could not see in him her little boy blue    why should you care   he said again   she rose and faced him   but i do care  boy   she said   how dare you pretend to think i don t   i care very tenderly and deeply     pooh   said the boy   do you suppose i wished you to marry a bare toed baby  with sand on its nose   he laughed wildly  paused and looked at her  then laughed again   a silly little ass that said it didn t  like girls  oh  i say  i think it s about time i was off  will you walk down to the gate      thanks  you are always most awfully good to me  i say  miss charteris  may i ask the professor s name     harvey   she said  quietly   kenrick harvey   the dull anguish at her heart seemed almost more than she could bear  yet what could she say or do  he was merely accepting her own decision    harvey   he said   why of course i know him  he s not much to look at  is he  but we always thought him an awfully good sort  and kind as they make  em  we considered him a confirmed bachelor  but well  we didn t  know he was waiting    they had reached the postern gate  oh  would he see the growing pain in her eyes  what was she losing  what had she lost  why did her whole life seem passing out through that green gate    good bye   he said   and please forget all the rot i talked about jericho  it goes with the spade and bucket  and all the rest  you have been most awfully kind to me  all along  but the very kindest thing you can do now  is to forget all the impossible things i thought and said    allow me     i ll shut the door    he put up his hand  to lift his cap  but he was bareheaded  he laughed again  turned  and passed out    boy  boy  come back   said christobel  but the door had closed on the first word   she stood alone   this time she did not wait  where was the good of waiting   she turned and walked slowly up the lawn  pausing to look at the flowers in the border  the yellow roses still looked golden  the jolly little  what d  you call  ems  lifted pale purple faces to the sky   but the boy was gone   she reached her chair  where he had placed it  deep in the shade of the mulberry tree  she felt tired  worn out  old   the boy was gone   she leaned back with closed eyes  she had hurt him so  she remembered all the glad  sweet confident things he had said each day  now she had hurt him so     what radiant faith  in love and in life  had been his  but she had spoiled that faith  and dimmed that brightness   suddenly she remembered his dead mother s prayer for him   i have prayed for thee  that thy faith fail not   and under those words she had written  christobel   would he want to obliterate that name  no  she knew he would not  nothing approaching a hard or a bitter thought could ever find a place in his heart  it would always be the golden heart of her little boy blue   tears forced their way beneath her closed lashes  and rolled slowly down her cheeks    oh  boy dear   she said aloud   i love you so i love you so     i know you do  dear   he said   it s almost unbelievable yet i know you do    she opened her eyes  the boy had come back  she had not heard his light step  on the springy turf  he knelt in his favourite place  on the left of her chair  and bent over her  once more his face was radiant  his faith had not failed   she looked up into his shining eyes  and the joy in her own heart made her dizzy    boy dear   she whispered   not my lips  because i am not altogether yours i may have to you know  the professor  but  oh boy  i can t  help it  i m afraid i care terribly    he was quite silent  yet it seemed to her that he had shouted  a burst of trumpet triumph seemed to fill the air   he bent lower   of course i wouldn t   christobel   he said   not before the seventh day  but there s a lot beside lips  and it s all so dear    then she felt the boy s kisses on her hair  on her brow  on her eyes   dear eyes   he said   shedding tears for my pain  ah  dear eyes   and he kissed them again   she put up her hand  to push him gently away  he captured it  and held it to his lips    stop  boy dear   she said   be good now  and sit down    he slipped to the grass at her feet  and rested his head against her knee   she stroked his hair  with gentle  tender touch  her little boy blue had come back to her  oh  bliss unutterable  why worry about the future    how silly we were  dear   he said   how silly to suppose we could part like that you and i   then his sudden merry laugh rang out oh  such music  such sweet music   i say  christobel   he said   it is all very well now to say  stop  and be good   but on the seventh day  when the walls fall down  and i march up into the citadel  i shall give you millions of kisses or will it be billions     judging from my knowledge of you  boy dear   she said   i rather think it would be billions    later  as they stood once more by the postern gate  he turned  framed in the doorway  smiling a last gay good bye   it was their second parting that day  and how different from the first  there was to be a third  unlike either  before the day was over  but its approach was  as yet  unsuspected   but as he stood in the doorway  full in a shaft of sunlight  the glad certainty in his eyes smote her with sudden apprehension    oh  boy dear   she said   take care  you are building castles again  they will tumble about our ears  i haven t  promised you anything  little boy blue of mine  and i am afraid i shall have to marry the professor     if you do  dear   he said   i shall have to give him a new umbrella as a wedding present   and the boy went whistling down the lane   but  out of sight of the postern gate and of the woman who  leaning against it  watched him to the turning  he dropped his bounding step and jaunty bearing  his face grew set and anxious  his walk  perplexed    oh  god   said the boy  as he walked   don t  let me lose her    a few minutes later  a telegram was put into his hand from the friend left on the coast  in charge of his newest aeroplane    arrange channel flight  if possible  day after to morrow     not i   said the boy  crumpling the message into his pocket   the day after to morrow is the seventh day    he was dining with friends  but an unaccountable restlessness seized him during the evening  he made his excuses  and returned to the bull hotel soon after nine o clock  the hall porter at once handed him a note  left by special messenger  ten minutes earlier  it was marked  urgent   the handwriting was christobel s   the boy flung away his cigarette  tore the note open  and turned to a light  it was very short and clear     boy dear  i must see you at once  you will find me in the garden    christobel    when the boy had turned the corner and disappeared  miss charteris passed through the little postern gate  and moved slowly up the lawn  ah  how different to her sad return from that gate an hour before   the william allen richardsons still opened their golden hearts to the sunset  the jolly little  what d  you call  ems  still lifted their purple faces to the sky  but instead of stabbing her with agony  they sang a fragrant psalm of love   ah  why was the boy so dear  why was the boy so near  she had watched him go striding down the lane  yet he still walked beside her  his gay young laugh of glad content was in her ears  his pure young kisses on her brow and eyes  his head against her knee   just as she reached the mulberry  jenkins hastened from the house  the note he brought  in a familiar handwriting  thin and pointed  was marked  urgent  in one corner  and  immediate  in the other  but miss ann s notes usually were one or other  this happened to be both    you need not wait  jenkins   she said   she stood close to a spreading branch of the mulberry  her tall head was up among the moving leaves  whispering  they caressed her  something withheld her from entering the soft shade  sacred to herself and the boy  she stood  to read ann harvey s letter   as she read  every vestige of colour left her face  bending over the letter  she might have been a sorely troubled and perplexed replica of the noble venus of milo   folding the letter  she went slowly up the lawn  still wearing that white look of cold dismay  she spoke to martha through the open window  keeping her face out of sight    martha   she said   i am obliged to go immediately to miss ann  if i am not back by eight o clock  i shall be remaining with her for dinner   she passed on  and martha turned to jenkins   by the way  jenkins was having an unusually festive time  during the last twenty four hours  martha had been kinder to him than he had ever known her to be  he was now comfortably ensconced in the windsor armchair in a corner of the kitchen  reading yesterday s daily paper  and enjoying his pipe  never before had his pipe been allowed in the kitchen  but he had just been graciously told he might bring it in  if he wouldn t  be  messy with the hashes   mrs  jenkins volunteering the additional remarkable information  that it was  good for the beetles   jenkins was doubtful as to whether this meant that his pipe gave pleasure to the beetles  or the reverse  but experience had taught him that a condition of peaceful uncertainty in his own mind was to be preferred to a torrent of vituperative explanation from martha  he therefore also received in silence the apparently unnecessary injunction not to go  crawlin  about all over the floor   it took  a figure to do that    eight o clock came  and miss charteris had not returned    remaining with  er for dinner   pronounced martha  flinging open the oven  and wrathfully relegating to the larder the chicken she had been roasting with extreme care   an  a precious poor dinner it ll be  jenkins  you may  ave this sparrow grass  i  aven t  the  eart  an  me  oping she d  ave  ad the sense to keep  im to dinner  knowing as there was a chicking an   grass for two  now what s took miss hann  urgent and immediate   i d like to know   continued martha  deriving considerable comfort from banging the plates and tumblers on to the kitchen table  with just as much violence as was consistent with their personal safety  as she walked round it  laying the table for supper   ate a biscuit  i should think  an  flown to  er cheat  i ve  no patience  no  that i  aven t    and martha attacked the loaf  with fury   at a quarter before nine  miss charteris returned  in a few moments the bell summoned jenkins  the note he was to take was also marked  immediate   he left it on the kitchen table  and  while he changed his coat  martha fetched her glasses  then she followed him to the pantry     ere  run man   she said   run  never mind your muffler  who wants a muffler in june   e s in it  it s something more than a biscuit  drat that woman    a quarter of an hour later  a tall white figure moved noiselessly down the lawn  to the seats beneath the mulberry  the full moon was just rising above the high red wall  gliding up among the trees  huge and golden through their branches  christobel charteris waited in the garden for the boy   he came   by then  the lawn was bathed in moonlight  she saw him  tall and slim  in the conventional black and white of a man s evening dress  pass silently through the postern gate  she noted that he did not bang it  he came up the lawn slowly for him  he wore no hat  and every clear cut feature of the clean shaven young face showed up in the moonlight   at the mulberry  he paused  uncertain  peering into the dark shadow    christobel   he said  softly    boy dear  i am here  come    he came  feeling his way among the chairs  and moving aside a table  which stood between   he found her  sitting where he had found her  on his return  three hours before  a single ray of moonlight pierced the thick foliage of the mulberry  and fell across her face  he marked its unusual pallor  he stood before her  put one hand on each arm of her chair  and bent over her    what is it   he said  softly   what is it  dear heart  it is so wonderful to be wanted  and sent for  but let me know quickly that you are not in any trouble    she looked up at him dumbly  during five  ten  twenty seconds  then she said   boy  i have something to tell you  will you help me to tell it     of course i will   he said   how can i help best     i don t  know   she answered   oh  i don t  know    he considered a moment  then he sat down on the grass at her feet  and leaned his head against her knees  she passed her fingers softly through his hair    what happened after i had gone   asked the boy    jenkins brought me a note from miss harvey  asking me to come to her at once  to hear some very wonderful news  intimately affecting herself  and the professor  and and me  she wrote very ecstatically and excitedly  poor dear  she always does  of course  i went     well   said the boy  gently  the pause was so very long  that it seemed to require supplementing  he felt for the other hand  which had been holding the lace at her breast  and drew it to his lips  it was wet with tears   the boy started  he sat up  turned  resting his arm upon her lap  and tried to see her face    go on  dear   he said   get it over     boy   said miss charteris   a rich old uncle of the harveys has died  leaving the professor a very considerable legacy  sufficient to make him quite independent of his fellowship  and of the production of the encyclopedia     well     they are very happy about it  naturally  poor ann is happier than i have ever seen her  and the chief cause of their joy appears to be that now the professor is  at last  in a position to marry     well     i have not seen him yet  but miss ann is full of it  she told me a good many very touching things  i had no idea it had meant so much to him all these years  boy dear     yes     i shall have to marry the professor    no answer    i don t  know how to make you understand why i feel so bound to them  they were very old friends of my father and mother  they were so good to me through all the days of sorrow  when i was left alone  miss ann is a great invalid  and very dependent upon love and care  and upon not being thwarted in her little hopes and plans  she expects to come and live in in her brother s home  she knows i should love to have her  and he has done so much for me  intellectually  so patiently kept my mind alive  when it was inclined to stagnate  and working  when it would have grown slack  he has given up hours of his valuable time to me  every week  for years    no answer   suddenly the moonlight  through an opening in the mulberry leaves  fell upon his upturned face  she saw the anguish in his eyes  she turned his head away  resting it against her knee  and clasped her hands upon it    boy dear  it is terribly hard for us  i know  in a most extraordinary way in a way i cannot understand you have won my body  it yearns to be with you  it aches if you suffer  it lives in your gladness  it grows young in your youth  nobody else has ever made me feel this  i do not suppose anybody else ever will  but oh boy bodies are not everything  bodies are the least of all  and i think i think the professor holds my mind  he won it long ago  i have grown much older since then  and very tired of waiting  but i can look back to the time when i used to think the greatest privilege in the world would be  to be the to marry the professor    she paused  and waited    bodies count   said the boy  in a low voice   you ll jolly well find  that bodies count    it was such a relief to hear him speak at last    oh  i know  boy dear   she said   but more between some  than others  the professor and i are united  primarily  on the mental and spiritual plane  being so sure of this  realizing the difference  makes it less hard  in a way  to to give up my little boy blue  boy dear  you must help me  because i love you as i have never loved anybody else in this world before  as i know i never shall love again  but i am bound in honour not to disappoint the man who knows i have waited for him  miss ann admitted to me to night that she has told him  she said  in the first moments of joy she had to tell him  he was so anxious  and so diffident  boy dear  had it not been for that  i think i should have begged off  but as he knows as they have trusted me dear  we must say  good bye  to night  he is going to write to me to morrow  asking if he may come  i shall say   yes       boy dear  is it very hard      oh  can t  you see where duty comes in  there can be no true happiness if one has failed to be true to what one knows is just and right     can t  you realize  boy  that they have been everything to me for seven years  you have come in  for seven days     time is nothing   said the boy  suddenly   you and i are one  christobel  eternally  indissolubly one  you will find it out  when it is too late  age is nothing  time is nothing  love is all    she hesitated  the boy s theories were so vital  so vigorous  so assured  was she making a mistake  there was no question as to the pain involved by her decision  but was that pain to result as she believed  in higher good to all  or was it to mean irreparable loss  the very knowledge that her body so yearned for him  led her to emphasize the fact that the boy could not oh surely could not be a fit mate for her mind  yet he was so confident  so sure of himself  in regard to her  on every point  so unhesitatingly certain that they were meant for each other   and then she saw ann harvey  with clasped hands  saying   darling child  forgive me  but i had to tell kenrick  he is so humble he was so diffident  so doubtful of his own powers of attraction  i had to tell him that i knew you had been very fond of him for years  i did not say much  sweet child  but just enough to give dear kenrick hope and confidence    she could see miss ann s delicate wrinkled face  the tearful eyes  the lavender ribbons on her lace cap  the mysterious hair brooch  fastening the old lace at her neck  the scene was photographed upon her memory  for  in that moment  hope the young hope  born of the youthful boy and his desires had died  christobel charteris had taken up the burden of life  a life apart from the seven days  romance  created by the amazing over confidence of her little boy blue   the masterful man attracts  but  in the end  it is usually the diffident man who wins  the innate unselfishness of the noblest type of woman  causes her to yield more readily to the insistence of her pity than to the force of her desire  in these cases  marriage and martyrdom are really though unconsciously synonymous  and the same pure  holy courage which went smiling to the stake  goes smiling to the altar  does a martyr s crown await it  in another world  possibly  the only perplexing question  in these cases  being  what awaits the wrecked life of  the other man    christobel charteris had put her hand to the plough  she would not look back    little boy blue   she said   you must say  good bye  and go  i am going to marry the professor quite soon  and i must not see you again  say  good bye   boy dear    then the boy s anguish broke through all bounds  he flung his arms around her  and hid his face in her lap  a sudden throb of speechless agony seemed to overwhelm them both  submerging all arguments  all casuistry  all obligations to others  in a molten ocean of love and pain   then she heard the boy pray   o god  give her to me  give her to me  o god  give her to me     hush  boy   she said   oh  hush    he was silent at once   then bending  she gathered him to her  holding his face against her breast  sheltering him in the tenderness of her arms  he had never seemed so completely her own little boy blue as in that moment  when she listened to his hopeless prayer   o god  give her to me   this was the little boy blue who tried to carry cannon balls  who faced the world  with sand upon his nose  cloudless faith in his bright eyes  indomitable courage in his heart  she forgot the man s estate to which he had attained  she forgot the man s request to which she had given a final denial  she held him as she had first longed to do  when his nurse  in unreasonable wrath  shook him on the sands  she rocked him gently to and fro  as his dead mother might have done  long years ago   oh  my little boy blue  my little boy blue   she said   suddenly she felt the boy s hot tears upon her neck   then  in undreamed of pain  her heart stood still  then the full passion of her tenderness awoke  and found voice in an exceeding bitter cry    oh  i cannot bear it  i cannot bear it  boy dear  oh  boy dear  you shall have all you wish all all      do you hear  my little boy blue  it shall all be for you  darling  all for you  nobody else matters  you shall have all you want all all all    silence under the mulberry tree  the silence of a great decision   then he drew himself gently but firmly from her arms   he stood before her  tall  erect  unbending  the moonlight fell upon his face  it had lost its look of youth  taking on a new power  it was the face of a man  and of a man who  having come to a decision  intended  at all costs  to abide by it    no  christobel   he said   no  my beloved  i could not accept happiness even such happiness at so great a cost to you  there could be no bliss for you  no peace  no satisfaction  even in our great love  if you had gone against your supreme sense of duty  your own high conception of right and wrong  also  christobel  dearest you must not give yourself in a rush of emotion  you must give yourself deliberately where your mind has chosen  and where your great soul is content  that being so  i must be off  christobel  and don t  you worry about me  you ve  been heavenly good to me  dear  and i ve  put you through so much  i will go up to town to night  i shall not come back  unless you send for me  but when you want me and send why  my love  i will come from the other end of the world    he stooped and took both her hands in his  lifted them reverently  tenderly  to his lips  held them there one moment  then laid them back upon her lap  and turned away   she saw him walk down the moonlit lawn  tall and erect  she saw him pass through the gate  without looking back  she heard it close quietly not with the old boyish bang yet close irrevocably  decisively   then she shut her eyes  and began again to rock gently to and fro  little boy blue was still in her arms  it comforted her to rock him there  but the man who had arisen and left her  when he might  taking advantage of her weakness  have won her against her own conscience and will  the man who  mastering his own agony  had thus been brave and strong for her had carried her whole heart with him  when he went out through the postern gate   in rising  he left the boy in her arms  through the long hard years to come  she prayed she might keep him there her own little boy blue   but he who went out alone  for her sake to face life without her  was the man she loved   she knew it  at last    and the evening and the morning were the fifth day       the sixth day  miss ann has  much to say   on the afternoon of the sixth day  at the hour which had hitherto been kept for the boy  christobel charteris  in response to another urgent and immediate summons  went to take tea with miss ann   it had been a long  dull  uneventful day  holding at first a certain amount of restless uncertainty as to whether the boy was really gone  mingled with apprehensive anticipation of a call from the professor   but before noon a reply paid telegram arrived from the boy  sent off at charing cross     good morning  all s well  just off for folkestone  please tell me how you are     to which  while jenkins and the telegraph boy waited  miss charteris replied     quite well  thank you  do be careful at folkestone     and afterwards thought of many other messages which she might have sent  holding more  and better expressed  but that precious moment in touch with the boy passed so quickly  and it seemed so impossible to think of anything but commonplace words  while jenkins stood at attention near the table  and the telegraph boy kept ringing his bicycle bell outside  as a reminder that he waited   yet her heart felt warmed and comforted by this momentary contact with the boy  he still cared to know how she was  and it was so like him to put   all s well   he wished her to know he had not gone down beneath his trouble   fanks  but i always does my own cawwying   brave little boy blue  of long ago   the expectation of the professor s note or call remained  keeping her anxious  until she heard from ann harvey  that her brother had been obliged to go to london on business  and would not return until the evening   come to tea with me  dear child   the note concluded   we have much to say    it seemed to christobel that there remained nothing which miss ann had not already said  in every possible form and way  nevertheless  she put on her hat  and went  miss ann had succeeded in impressing all her friends with the conviction that her wishes must never be thwarted   miss ann had named her villa  shiloh   undoubtedly a suitable name  so far as she herself was concerned  her time being mostly spent upon a comfortable sofa in her tiny drawing room  or reclining on a wicker lounge beneath the one tree in her small garden  or being carefully wheeled out in a bath chair   but nobody else found miss ann s villa in any sense a  resting place   she had a way of keeping everybody about her from jaded emma to the most casual caller on the move  while she herself presented a delicate picture of frail inactivity  immediately upon their arrival  her friends found an appointed task awaiting them  but it was always something which miss ann would have given to somebody else to do  had they not chanced at that moment to appear  and they were usually left with the feeling that the particular somebody else whose privilege they  in their well meant zeal  had usurped would have accomplished it better   directing them from the sofa  miss ann kept her entourage busy and perpetually on the move  yet she never felt she was asking much of them  nor  however weary at the conclusion of the task  did they ever feel much had been accomplished  owing to the judicious use of the word  just     my dear   miss ann would say   as you are here  will you just clean the canary   cleaning the canary meant a very thorough turning out of an intricate little brass cage  several journeys up and down stairs in quest of sand  seed  and brass polish  and an out door excursion to a neighbour s garden for groundsel  the canary s name was  sweetie weet   and  however much annoyed miss ann s friends might be feeling with the canary  they had to call him  sweetie weet  all the time they  cleaned him   lest his flutterings should upset miss ann  now you cannot say  sweetie weet  in an angry voice  try  and you will see  consequently miss ann s friends had no vent for their feelings during the process of getting a rather large hand in and out of a very small brass door with a spring  which always snapped to  at the wrong moment  while the hand  which seemed to its possessor larger than it had ever seemed before  was crooked round in an impossible position in a strained attempt to fix sweetie weet s perches  if anything went wrong during the cleaning process  miss ann  from her vantage ground on the sofa would sigh  and exclaim   poor patient little sweetie weet   miss ann was in full possession of all her faculties  her hearing was preternaturally sharp  it was no use saying  fiend   to sweetie weet  in an emphatic whisper  he fluttered the more   when the task was completed  the cage had to be brought to miss ann s couch for inspection  she then usually discovered the perches to have been put back before they were perfectly dry  now nothing as surely you hardly ought to require to be told was so prejudicial to sweetie weet s delicate constitution as to have damp wood beneath his precious little feet  consequently all the perches had just to be taken out again  dried before the kitchen fire  and put back once more  when this mandate went forth  the glee in the bright black eyes in sweetie weet s yellow head was unmistakable  he shared miss ann s mania for keeping people busy   when  at last  the second installation of perches was over  and the cage was suspended from the brass chain in the sunny window  sweetie weet poured forth a shrill crescendo of ear piercing sarcasm  a little song of praise  miss ann called it directed full at the hot and exhausted friend  who was applying a pocket handkerchief to the wire scratches on the back of her hand  and trying to smile at miss ann s recital of all emma would say  when she found that her special privilege and delight the cleaning of sweetie weet had been wrested from her by the over zealous friend  as a matter of fact  jaded emma s personal remarks about sweetie weet  during the perch drying process in the kitchen  had been of a nature which would not bear repeating in sweetie weet s presence  and had provided the only amusement the friend had got out of the whole performance   when christobel charteris arrived at shiloh  she found miss ann on the green velvet sofa  looking very frail and ethereal  a shetland shawl about her shoulders  fastened by the largest and most mysterious of her hair brooches a gold mounted oval brooch  in which a weeping willow of fair hair drooped over a sarcophagus of dark hair  while a crescent moon of grey hair kept watch over both  this funereal collection of family hair always possessed a weird fascination for small children  brought by their parents to call upon miss ann  the most undemonstrative became affectionate  and hastened with ready docility to the sofa to kiss miss ann  in order to obtain a closer view  and to settle the much disputed point as to the significance of a small round object in the left hand corner at the bottom  in fact  to the undisguised dismay of his mother  a sturdy youngster once emerged from miss ann s embrace  exclaiming eagerly to his little sister   it s a furze bush  not a hedgehog   an unfortunate remark  which might have been taken by miss ann to refer to even more personal matters than a detail in her brooch   christobel herself was not altogether free from the spell of this hirsute cemetery  chiefly because she knew it was worn on days when deep emotion was to be felt and expressed  at sight of it  she was quite prepared for the tearful smile with which miss ann signed to her to close the door  then extending her arms   sweet sister   she said  with emotion   let me take you to my heart    it was somewhat startling to christobel to be apostrophized as  sister  by miss ann  the boy had made her feel so young  and so completely his contemporary  that if miss ann had called her  daughter   or even  granddaughter   it would have seemed more appropriate  also her magnificent proportions constituted a somewhat large order for miss ann s proposed embrace   however  she knelt beside the sofa  and allowed herself to be taken to miss ann s heart in sections  then  having found and restored miss ann s lace pocket handkerchief  she seated herself in a low chair beside the couch  hoping for enlightenment upon the immediate prospects of her own future   miss ann wept gently for a while  christobel sat silent  her recent experience of tears  wrung from such deep anguish of soul  made it less easy for her to feel sympathetic towards tears which flowed from no apparent cause  and fell delicately into perfumed lace  so she waited in silence  while miss ann wept   the room was very still  the bang with which the boy usually made his entry anywhere  would have been terrific in its joyful suddenness  at the mere thought of it  christobel s heart stood still and listened  but this was a place into which the boy would never make an entry  noisy or otherwise  besides the boy was gone  oh  silent  sober  sorry world  the boy was gone   sweetie weet put his head on one side  and chirped interrogatively  in his judgment  the silence had lasted sufficiently long   miss ann dried her eyes  making an effort to control her emotion  then she spoke  in a voice which still trembled    dearest child   she said   i want you just to cover this book for me  emma has offered to do it  several times  but i said   no  emma  we must keep it for miss christobel  i do not know what she would say to you  if you took to covering my books   emma is a good soul  and willing  but has not the mind and method required to cover a book properly  if you will just run up to my room  dear child  you will find a neat piece of whity brown paper laid aside on purpose     hush  sweetie weet  christobel knows you are pleased to see her     it is either on the ottoman behind the screen  or in the top left hand drawer of the mahogany chest  between the window and the fireplace  ah  how much we have come through  during the last twenty four hours  the scissors  dear love  are hanging by black tape from a nail in the store room  you require a large and common pair for cutting brown paper  how truly wonderful are the ways of providence  dear christobel  the paste is in the little cupboard under the stairs    when miss charteris had finished covering the book  having bent upon it all the mind and method it required  she forestalled the setting of another task  by saying firmly   i want an important talk now  please  ann  are you sure you told your brother that i had cared for him for years     darling  dear kenrick was so diffident  so unable to realize his own powers of attraction  so     do you think it was fair toward a woman  even if it were true  to tell a man who had never asked her love  that that love has long been his     sweet child  how crudely you put it  i merely hinted  whispered  gave the most delicate indications of what i knew to be your feeling  for you do love my brother  do you not  dear christobel     i think   said miss charteris  slowly  weighing each word   i think i love the professor as a woman loves a book    there was a moment of tense silence in miss ann s drawing room  christobel charteris looked straight before her  a stern light upon her face  as of one confronted on the path of duty by the clear shining of the mirror of self revelation   into miss ann s pale blue eyes shot a gleam of nervous anxiety   sweetie weet chirped  interrogatively   then miss ann  recovering  clasped her hands   ah  what a beautiful definition   she said   what could be more pure  more perfect    miss charteris knew a love of a very different kind  which was absolutely pure  and altogether perfect  but that was the love she had put from her    a woman could hardly marry a book   she said   miss ann gave a little deprecatory shriek   darling child   she cried   no simile  however beautiful  should be pressed too far  your exquisite description of your love for dear kenrick merely assures us that your union with him will prove one of complete contentment to the mind  and the mind that sensitive instrument  attuned to all the immensities of the intellectual spheres the mind is what really matters     bodies count   said miss charteris  with conviction  adding beneath her breath  the dawning of a smile in her sad eyes   we shall jolly well find  bodies count    miss ann s hearing  as we have already remarked  was preternaturally sharp  she started   my dear christobel  what an expression  and do you not think  that  under these circumstances  any mention of bodies savours of impropriety    miss charteris turned quickly  the colour flamed into her beautiful face  the glint of angry indignation flashed from her eyes  but the elderly figure on the couch looked so small and frail  to wound and crush it would be so easy  and so unworthy of her strength  and wider experience   suddenly she remembered a little blue back  round with grief and shame  a small sandy face  silent and unflinching  a brave little heart which kept its faith in god  and prayed on trustfully  while nurses misunderstood and bullied  then miss charteris conquered her own wrath    dear ann   she said  gently   do you really believe your brother would be much disappointed if after all when he asks me to marry him which he has not done yet i feel it better not to do so     my darling child   exclaimed miss ann  and her hair brooch flew open  as if to accentuate her horror and amazement   my darling child  think how patiently he has waited  remember the long years  remember     yes  i know   said miss charteris   you told me all that last night  didn t  you  but it seems to me that  if a man can wait twelve years  he might as well wait twenty     so he would have   cried miss ann   undoubtedly dear kenrick would have waited twenty years  had it not been for this fortunate legacy  which places him in a position to marry at once  but why should you wish to keep him waiting any longer  is not twelve years sufficiently long    miss charteris smiled   twelve days would be too long for some people   she said  gently   i have no wish to keep him waiting  but you must remember  ann  the professor has  as yet  spoken no word of love to me     dear child   said miss ann  eagerly   he would have come to you to day  but imperative legal business  connected with our uncle s will  took him to town  i know for certain that he intends writing to you this evening  and  if you then give him leave to do so  he will call upon you to morrow  oh  darling girl  you will not disappoint us  we have so trusted you  so believed in you  a less scrupulously honourable man than kenrick  might have tried to bind you by a promise  before he was in a position to offer you immediate marriage  think of all the hopes the hopes and p plans  which depend upon your faithfulness   miss ann dissolved into tears but not to a degree which should hinder her flow of eloquence   ah  sweetest child  you knelt beside this very sofa  five years ago  and you said   ann  i think any woman might be proud to become the wife of the professor   have you forgotten that you said that  kneeling beside this very sofa     i have not forgotten   said miss charteris   and i think so still     then you will marry kenrick   said miss ann  through her tears   christobel charteris rose  she stood  for a moment  tall and immovable  in the small  low room  crowded with knick knacks china  bric a brac  ferns in painted pots  embroidery  photograph frames overseated with easy chairs  which  in their turn  were overfilled with a varied assortment of cushions  miss ann s drawing room gave the effect of a rather prettily arranged bazaar  you mentally pictured yourself walking round  admiring everything  but seeing nothing you liked quite well enough to wish to buy it  and take it home   christobel charteris  tall and stately  in her simple white gown  looked so utterly apart from the trumpery elegance of these surroundings  as the boy had said  the mellow beauty of his ancestral homes would indeed be a fit setting for her stately grace  but she had sent away the boy  with his beautiful castles in the air  and places in the shires  the atmosphere and surroundings of shiloh were those to which she must be willing to bend her fastidious taste  miss ann would expect to make her home with the professor    then you will marry kenrick   whispered miss ann  through her lace pocket handkerchief   christobel bent over her  tenderly  fastening the clasp of the mysterious hair brooch    dear ann   she said   it will not be leap year again  until       and  meanwhile  the professor has not proposed marriage to me    miss ann instantly brightened  laughing gaily  she wiped away a few remaining tears    ah  naughty   she said   naughty  to make me tell  but as you will ask he is going to write to night  but you must never let him know i told you  and now i want you just to find the spectator it is laid over that exquisitely embroidered blotter on the writing table in the window  sent me last christmas by that kind creature  lady goldsmith  so thoughtful  tasteful  and quite touching  emma  careful soul  spread it over the blotter  while darling sweetie weetie took his bath  dear pet  it is a sight to see him splash and splutter  lady goldsmith thinks so much of dear kenrick  the first time she saw him  she was immensely struck by his extraordinarily clever appearance  he sat exactly opposite her at a guildhall banquet  and she told me afterwards that the mere sight of him was sufficient to take away all inclination for food  excepting for that intellectual nourishment which he is so well able to supply  i thought that was rather well expressed  and  coming from a florid woman  such as lady goldsmith  was quite a tribute to my brother  you would call lady goldsmith  florid   would you not  dear christobel      oh  you do not know her by sight  i am surprised  as the wife of the professor  you will soon know all these distinguished people by sight  yes  she is undoubtedly florid  and inclined to be what my dear father used to call  a woman of a stout habit   this being the case  it was certainly a tribute a tribute of which you and i  dearest child  have a right to feel justly proud     oh  is it still damp  naughty sweetie weet  don t  you think it might be wise  just to take it to the kitchen  emma  good soul  will let you dry it before the fire  i have heard of fatalities caused by damp newspapers  precious child  we can have you run no risks  what would kenrick say  but when it is absolutely dry  i want you just to explain to me the gist of that article on the effect of oriental literature on modern thought  kenrick tells me you have read it  he wishes to discuss it with me  i really cannot undertake to read it through  i have not the time required  yet i must be prepared to talk it over intelligently with my brother  when next he pays me a visit  he may look in this evening  weary with his day in town  and requiring the relaxation of a little intellectual conversation  i must be ready    an hour later  somewhat tired in body  and completely exhausted in mind  miss charteris walked home  she made a detour  in order to pass along the lane  and enter through the postern gate at the bottom of the garden   she opened it  and passed in   a shaft of sunlight lay along the lawn  the jolly little  what d  you call  ems  lifted gay purple faces to the sky   she paused in the doorway  trying to realize how this quiet green seclusion  the old fashioned flower borders  the spreading mulberry tree  the quaint white house  in the distance  with its green shutters  must have looked to the boy each day  as he came in  she knew he had more eye for colour  and more knowledge of artistic effect  than his casual acquaintances might suppose  it would not surprise her some day to find  as one of the gems of the new gallery  a reproduction of her own garden  with a halo of jolly little  what d  you call  ems  in the borders  and an indication of seats  deep in the shadow of the mulberry tree  she would not need to refer to the catalogue for the artist s name  the boy had had a painting in the academy the year before  she had chanced to see it  noticing the name of her little boy blue of the dovercourt sands in the catalogue  she had made her way through the crowded rooms  and found his picture  it hung on the line  she had been struck by its thoughtful beauty  and wealth of imaginative skill  she had not forgotten that picture  and during all these days she had been quietly waiting to hear the boy say he had had a painting in the academy  then she was going to tell him she had seen it  had greatly admired it  and had noted with pleasure all the kind things critics had said of it   but  the subject of pictures not having come up  it had not occurred to the boy to mention it  the boy never talked of what he had done  because he had done it  but were a subject mentioned upon which he was keen  he would bound up  with shining eyes  and tell you all he knew about it  all he had seen  heard  and done  all he was doing  and all he hoped to do in the future  in connexion with that particular thing  he would never have thought of informing you that he owned three aeroplanes  but if the subject of aviation came up  and you said to the boy   do you know anything about it   he would lean forward  beaming at you  and say   i should jolly well think i do   and talk aeroplanes to you for as long as you were willing to listen  this trait of the boy s  caused shallow minded people to consider him conceited  but the woman he loved knew how to distinguish between keenness and conceit  between exuberant enthusiasm and egotistical self assertion  and the woman who loved him  smiled tenderly as she remembered that even on the day when she scolded him  and he had to admit his  barely respectable b a    he had not told her of the painting hung on the line and mentioned in the times  yet if the question of art had come up  the boy would very probably have sat forward in his chair  and talked about his painting  straight on end  for half an hour   she still stood beneath the archway  in the red brick wall  as these thoughts chased quickly through her mind  she would have made a fair picture for any one who had chanced to be waiting beneath the mulberry tree  with eyes upon the gate    straight on end for half an hour  he would have talked about his picture  and how bright his eyes would have been  and then i should have said   i saw it  boy dear  and it was quite as beautiful as you say   and he would have answered   it jolly well gave you the feeling of the scene  didn t  it  christobel   and i should have known that his delight in it  as an artistic success  had nothing to do with the fact that it was painted by himself  just because egotism is impossible to him  he is free to be so full of vivid enthusiasm    she smiled again  a warm glow seemed to enfold her   how well i know my boy   she said aloud  then remembered with a sudden pang that she must not call him her boy  she had let him go  she was very probably going to marry the professor  she had not with the whole of her being wanted him to stay  until he had had the manliness to rise up and go  then it had been too late  ah  was it too late  if the boy came back to plead once more  if once again she could hear him say   age is nothing  time is nothing  love is all   would she not answer   yes  guy  love is all    the blood rushed into her sweet proud face  the name of the man she loved had come into her mind unconsciously  it had never yet as a name for him passed her lips  that she should unconsciously call him so in her heart  gave her another swift moment of self revelation   she closed the gate gently  careful not to let it bang  as she passed up the lawn  her heart stood still  it seemed to her that he must be waiting  in the shade of the mulberry tree   she hardly dared to look  she felt so sure he was there     yes  she knew he was there     she felt certain the boy had come back  he could not stay away from her on his sixth day  had he not said he would  march round  every day  ah  dear waiting army of israel  here was jericho hastening to meet it  why had she allowed ann harvey to keep her so late  why had she gone at all  during the boy s own time  she might have known he would come     should she walk past the mulberry  as if making for the house  just for the joy of hearing him call  christobel   no  that would not be quite honest  knowing he was there  and they were always absolutely honest with one another   she passed  breathlessly  under the drooping branches  her cheeks glowed  her lips were parted  her eyes shone with love and expectation   she lifted a hanging bough  and passed beneath   his chair was there  and hers  but they were empty  the boy being the boy had not come back   presently she went slowly up to the house   a telegram lay on the hall table  she knew at once from whom it came  there was but one person who carried on a correspondence by telegraph  reply paid was written on the envelope   she stood quite still for a moment  then she opened it slowly  telegrams from the boy gave her a delicious memory of the way he used to jump about  he would be out of his chair  and sitting at her feet  before she knew he was going to move   she opened it slowly  turned to a window  and read it     how are you  dear  please tell me  i am going to do my big fly to morrow  i jolly well mean to break the record  wish me luck     she took up the reply paid form and wrote     quite well  good luck  but please be careful  little boy blue     she hesitated a moment  before writing the playful name by which she so often called him  but his telegram was so absolutely the boy  all over  it was best he should know nothing of  the man she loved   who had gone out at the gate  it was best he should not know what she would have called him  had he been under the mulberry just now  she was undoubtedly going to marry the professor  in which case she would never call the boy anything but  little boy blue   so she put it into her telegram  as a repartee to his audacious  dear   then she went out  and sent it off herself  it was comforting to have something  however small  to do for him   she came in again  dressed for the evening  and dined  she was thoroughly tired  and one sentence beat itself incessantly against the mirror of her reflection  like a frightened bird with a broken wing   he is going to do a big fly to morrow     he is going to do a big fly to morrow  little boy blue is going to fly and break the record    she sat in the stillness of her drawing room  and tried to read  but between her eyes and the printed page  burned in letters of fire   he is going to fly to morrow    she went down the garden to the chairs beneath the mulberry tree  it was cooler there  but the loneliness was too fierce an agony   she walked up and down the lawn  now bathed in silvery moonlight   he is going to do a big fly to morrow  he jolly well means to break the record    she passed in  and went to her bedroom  she lay in the darkness and tried to sleep  she tried in vain  what if he got into cross currents  what if the propeller broke  what if the steering gear twisted  she began remembering every detail he had told herself and mollie  when she sat listening  thinking of him as mollie s lover  though all the while he had been her little boy blue      oh of course then it is all u p  but there must be pioneers    at last she could bear it no longer  she lighted her candle  and rose  she went to her medicine cupboard  and did a thing she had never done before  in the whole of her healthy life  she took a sleeping draught  the draught was one of miss ann s  left behind at the close of a recent visit  she knew it contained chiefly bromide  harmless but effective   she put out the light  and lay once more in darkness   the bromide began to act   the bird with the broken wing became less insistent   the absent boy drew near  and bent over  kneeling beside her   she talked to him softly  her voice sounded far away  and unlike her own   be careful  little boy blue   she said   you may jolly well what an expression  break the record if you like  but don t  break yourself  because  if you do  you will break my heart    the bromide was acting strongly now  the bird with the broken wing had gone  there was a strange rhythmical throbbing in her ears  it was the boy s aeroplane  but it had started without him  she knew sleep was coming  merciful oblivion  yet now she was too happy to wish to sleep   the boy drew nearer    oh  boy dear  i love you so   she whispered into the throbbing darkness   i love you so     i know you do  dear   said the boy   it is almost unbelievable  christobel  but i know you do    then she put up her arms  and drew him to her breast   thus the boy though far away marched round    and the evening and the morning were the sixth day       an interlude   as a dream  when one awaketh   when miss charteris opened her eyes  the sun was streaming into her room  the sense of having slept heavily and unnaturally lay upon her  she had not heard martha s entry  but her blinds were up  and the tea on the tray beside her bed was still fresh and hot   she took a cup  and the after effects of the bromide seemed to leave her   she dressed  and went downstairs   on the breakfast table  beside her plate  lay the professor s letter  when she had poured out her coffee and buttered her toast  she opened and read it   the letter was exactly such as she had always dreamed the professor would write  if he ever came to the point of making her a proposal  he touched on their long friendship  on how much it had meant to them both  he said he had often hoped for the possibility of a closer tie  but had not felt justified in suggesting it  until he was in a position to offer her a suitable home and income  this was now fortunately the case  therefore he hastened to write and plead his cause  though keenly conscious of how little there was in himself calculated to call forth in a woman the affection which it was his earnest hope and desire to win  she had trusted him as a friend  an intellectual guide and comrade  during many years  if she could now bring herself to trust him in a yet more intimate relation  he would endeavour never to disappoint or fail her   the letter was signed    yours in sincere devotion    kenrick harvey    a postscript requested to be allowed to call  at the usual hour  that afternoon  for a reply   miss charteris wrote a brief note of thanks and appreciation  and gave the professor leave to call at three   the professor called at three   he knocked and rang  and fumbled long over the umbrella stand in the hall  he seemed to be taking all the umbrellas out  and putting them back again   at last he appeared at the door of the drawing room  where miss charteris awaited him  he was very nervous  he repeated the substance of his letter  only rather less well expressed  he alluded to miss ann  and to the extreme happiness and pleasure to her of having christobel as a sister  but he completely ignored  both in the letter and in conversation  miss ann s betrayal of christobel s confidence  for this she was grateful to him   as soon as the professor  having floundered through the unusual waters of expressed sentiment  stepped out on to the high and dry path of an actual question  miss charteris answered that question in the affirmative  and accepted the professor s offer   he rose  and held her hand for a few moments  looking at her with great affection through his glasses  which did not at all impede the warmth of his regard  in fact  being powerful convex lenses  they magnified it  then he kissed her rather awkwardly on the brow  and hurried back to his seat   a somewhat strained silence would have followed  had not the professor had an inspiration   drawing a book from his pocket  he looked at her as you look at a child for whom you have a delightful surprise in store    that er matter being satisfactorily settled  my dear christobel   he said   should we not find it decidedly er refreshing to spend an hour over our persian translation    miss charteris agreed at once  but while the professor read  translated  and expounded  expatiating on the interest and beauty of various passages  her mind wandered   she found herself picturing the boy under similar circumstances  how the boy would have behaved during the first hour of engagement  what the boy would have said  what the boy would have done  she was not quite sure what the boy would have done  she had never experienced the boy with the curb completely off  but she suddenly remembered   millions  or would it be billions   and the recollection gave her a shock of such vivid reaction  that she laughed aloud   the professor paused  and looked up in surprise  then he smiled  indulgently    my dear er christobel  this passage is not intended to be humorous   he said    i know it is not   replied miss charteris   i beg your pardon  i laughed involuntarily    the professor resumed his reading   no  she was not quite sure as to all the boy would have done  but she knew quite well what he would have said   and here the boy  quite unexpectedly  took a first in classics  for what the boy would have said would certainly have been greek to the professor   after this  events followed one another so rapidly that the whole thing became dream like to miss charteris  she found herself helpless in the grip of miss ann s iron will up to now  carefully shrouded in shetland and lace  at last she understood why emma s old mother had had to die alone in a little cottage away in northumberland  emma  good soul  being too devoted to her mistress to ask for the necessary week  in order to go home and nurse her mother  emma had seemed a broken woman  ever since  and christobel understood now the impossibility of any one ever asking miss ann for a thing which miss ann had made up her mind not to grant   she and the professor now became puppets in miss ann s delicate hands  miss ann lay upon her couch  and pulled the wires  the professor danced  because he had not the discernment to know he was dancing  miss charteris  because she had not the heart to resist  the boy having gone out of her life  nothing seemed to matter  it was her duty to marry the professor  and there is nothing to be gained by the postponement of duty   but it was miss ann who insisted on the wedding taking place within a week  it was miss ann who reminded them that  the long vacation having just commenced  the professor could easily be away  and there were researches connected with his encyclopedia which it was of the utmost importance he should immediately make in the museums and libraries of brussels  it was miss ann who insisted upon a special licence being obtained  and who overruled christobel s desire to be married by her brother  the bishop  miss ann had become quite hysterical at the idea of the bishop being brought back from a tour he was making in ireland  and christobel yielded the more readily  because her brother s arrival would undoubtedly have meant mollie s  and mollie s presence  even if she refrained from protest and expostulation  would have brought such poignant memories of the boy   so it came to pass  with a queer sense of the whole thing being dream like and unreal  that miss charteris who should have had the most crowded and most popular wedding in cambridge found herself standing  as a bride  beside the professor  in an ill ventilated church  at ten o clock in the morning  being married by an old clergyman she had never seen before  who seemed partially deaf  and partially blind  and wholly inadequate to the solemn occasion  with miss ann and her faithful emma  sniffing in a pew on one side  while jenkins breathed rather heavily in a pew  on the other  martha had flatly refused to attend  and when miss charteris sent for her to bid her good bye  martha had appeared  apparently in her worst and most morose temper  then had suddenly broken down  and  exclaiming wildly    ow about  im   had thrown her apron over her head  and left the room  sobbing    how about him  how about him    each turn of the wheels reiterated the question as she drove to shiloh to pick up miss ann  then on to the church where the professor waited   how about him  but he had left her to do that which she felt to be right  and she was doing it   nevertheless  martha s wild outburst had brought the boy very near  and he seemed with her as she walked up the church   her mind wandered during the reading of the exhortation  in this nightmare of a wedding she seemed to have no really important part to play  the boy would burst in  in a minute  and a shaft of light would come with him  he would walk straight up the church to her  saying   we have jolly well had enough of this  christobel   then they would all wake up  and he would whirl her away in a motor and she would say   boy dear  don t  exceed the speed limit    but the boy did not burst in  and the professor s hands  looking unusually large in a pair of white kid gloves  were twitching nervously  for an emphatic question was being put to him by the old clergyman  who had emerged from his hiding place behind the prayer book  as soon as the exhortation was over   the professor said   i will   with considerable emotion  while miss ann sobbed audibly into her lace pocket handkerchief   christobel looked at the professor  his outward appearance seemed greatly improved  his beard had been trimmed  his hair what there was of it cut  he had not once looked at her since she entered the church and took her place at his side  but she knew  if he did look  his eyes would be kind kind  with a magnified kindness  behind the convex lenses  the boy had asked whether she loved the professor s mouth  eyes  and hair  what questions the amazing boy used to ask  and she had answered   but here a silence in the church recalled her wandering thoughts  the all important question had been put to her  she had not heard one word of it  yet the church awaited her  i will    the silence became alarming  this was the exact psychological moment in which the boy should have dashed in to the rescue  but the boy did not dash in   then christobel charteris did a thing perhaps unique in the annals of brides  but essentially characteristic of her extreme honesty    i am sorry   she said  in a low voice   i did not hear the question  will you be good enough to repeat it    miss ann  in the pew behind  gasped audibly  the old clergyman peered at her  in astonishment  over his glasses  his eyes were red rimmed and bloodshot   then he repeated the question slowly and deliberately  introducing a tone of reproof  which made of it a menace  miss charteris listened carefully to each clause and at the end she said   i will    whereupon  with much fumbling  the professor and the old clergyman between them  succeeded in finding a ring  and in placing it upon the third finger of her left hand  as they did so  her thoughts wandered again  she was back in the garden with the boy  he had caught her left hand in both his  and kissed it  then  dividing the third finger from the others  and holding it apart with his strong brown ones  he had laid his lips upon it  with a touch of unspeakable reverence and tenderness  she understood now  why the boy had kissed that finger separately  she looked down at it  the professor s ring encircled it   then the old clergyman said   let us pray   and  kneeling meekly upon her knees  christobel charteris prayed  with all her heart  that she might be a good wife to her old friend  the professor   from the church  they drove straight to the station  miss ann s plan for them being  that they should lunch in london  reach folkestone in time for tea  and spend a day or two there  at a boarding house kept by an old cronie of miss ann s  before crossing to boulogne  en route for brussels   christobel disliked the idea of the boarding house  extremely  she had never  in her life  stayed at a boarding house  moreover it seemed to her that a wedding journey called imperatively for hotels and the best of hotels  but miss ann had dismissed the question with an authoritative wave of the hand  and a veiled insinuation that hotels particularly metropole hotels were scarcely proper places  dear miss slinker s boarding house would be so safe and nice  and the company so congenial  but here the professor had interposed  laying his hand gently on christobel s   my dear ann  we take our congenial company with us    this was the farthest excursion into the realm of sentiment  upon which the professor had as yet ventured  the sober  middle aged side of miss charteris had appreciated it  with a certain amount of grateful emotion  but the youthful soul of christobel had suddenly realized how the boy would slap his leg  and rock  over the recital of such a sentence  and  between the two  she had been reduced to a condition bordering on hysterics   they travelled from cambridge in a first class compartment  had it to themselves  and fell quite naturally into the style of conversation which had always characterized their friendship  meeting each other s minds  not over the happenings of a living present  but in a mutual appreciation of the great intellects of a dead and gone past  before long  the professor had whisked his favourite persian poet from the tail pocket of his coat  christobel had provided paper and pencil  and they were deep in translation   arrived at liverpool street station  they entered a four wheeler  and trundled slowly off to cannon street  christobel had imagined four wheelers to be obsolete  but the professor dismissed her suggestion of a taxi  as being  a needlessly rapid mode of progression  indubitably fraught with perpetual danger   and proceeded to hail the sleepy and astonished driver of a four wheeled cab    oh  boy dear  what would you have said to that four wheeler you dear record breaking  speed limit exceeding  astonishingly rapid boy  that ancient four wheeler  trundling past the bank of england  the royal exchange  the mansion house  up king william street  and round into cannon street  endlessly blocked  continually pulling up  then starting on  only to be stopped again  and your beloved inside it  boy dear  looking out of the ramshackle old window  in a vain endeavour to see something of the london you had planned to show her in your own delightful extravagant way  oh  boy dear  keep out of this  it is not your show  this four wheeler has been hailed and engaged by the professor  the lady within is the bride of the professor  hands off  boy    they drew up  for a few minutes  outside a bookseller s in new broad street  on the left hand side  just after they had trundled into it a delightful little place  crammed  lined  almost carpeted  with books  the professor plunged in  upsetting a pile of magazines in his hasty entrance through the narrow doorway  here he always found precisely the book he happened to be requiring for his latest research  with an incoherent remark to the proprietor  who advanced to meet him  the professor became immediately absorbed  in a far corner of the shop  oblivious of his cab  his bride  and his train  christobel had followed him  and stood  a dignified  but somewhat lonely figure  just within the doorway  she had been to this shop with her father  during his lifetime  on several occasions  and had since often written for books  the bookseller came forward  he was a man possessed of the useful faculty of remembering faces and the names appertaining to them  also he had cultivated the habit of taking an intelligent interest in his customers  but he did not connect this beautiful waiting figure  with the absorbed back of the professor    what can i do for you to day  miss charteris   he inquired  with ready courtesy   christobel started   nothing to day  thank you  mr  taylor  but i am much obliged to you for so often supplying my requirements by return of post  and  by the way  you have an excellent memory  it is many years since i came here last  with my father     professor charteris was one of my best customers   said the bookseller  in an undertone of deferential sympathy   i never knew a finer judge of a book than he  if i may be allowed to say so  i deeply deplored his loss  miss charteris    christobel smiled  and gently unbent  allowing the kindly expression of appreciation and regret to reach her with comfort in these moments of dream like isolation  a friendly hand seemed to have been outstretched across the chasm which divides the passionately regretted past  from the scarcely appreciated present  she could see her father s tall scholarly figure  as he stood lovingly fingering a book  engaged in earnest conversation with mr  taylor  regardless of the passing of time  until she was obliged to lay her hand on his arm  and hurry him through the crowded streets  down the steep incline  to the platform from which the cambridge express was on the point of starting  and when safely seated  with barely a minute to spare  he would turn to her  with a smile of gentle reproof  saying   but  my dear child  we had not concluded our conversation   and she would laugh and say   but we had to get home to night  papa   whereupon he would lean back  contentedly  replying   quite right  my dear  so we had    ah  happy those whose fathers and mothers still walk the earth beside them  youth remains  notwithstanding the passing of years  while there is still a voice to say  in reproof or approbation   my child    but the bookseller  not yet connecting her with the professor  still waited her pleasure  and suddenly a thought struck christobel  an eager wish awoke within her    mr  taylor   she said  hurriedly   can you supply me with the very newest thing on the subject of aviation  i want to learn all there is to know about propellers  steering gear  cross currents  and how to avoid the dangers    she stopped short  the professor had found what he wanted  and was fumbling for his purse   the bookseller turned quickly to a pile at his elbow  took up a paper covered book  and placed it in her hands   the very latest   he said   published yesterday  you will find in it all you want to know   then  as he handed the professor his change   allow me to place it to your account  miss charteris   he said   experiencing a quite unaccountable sense of elation and fresh interest in life  christobel  armed with her book on aviation  re entered the four wheeler  the professor  absorbed in his own purchase  had not noticed her private transaction  he followed her into the cab  and made three ineffectual attempts to close the door  just as the driver was slowly beginning to prepare to climb down  mr  taylor came across the crowded pavement  to their rescue  released the professor s coat tail  shut them in  and signed to the cabman to drive on  with a good deal of  gee up  and whip flourishing  they re commenced to trundle  mr  taylor was not merely a provider of literature  he was also a keen observer of life  and of human nature  as christobel leaned forward to acknowledge his help  and to smile her farewell  his expression seemed to say   a four wheeler  professor harvey  and the latest work on aviation  an unusual combination    very unusual   she said to herself  and smiled again  then it seemed to her that her friend of the bookshop had said   you will find what you want  on page       she knew he had not  as a matter of fact  mentioned any page  but the figures came into her mind  she opened the book  and glanced at page      it was headed   fine performances by mr  guy chelsea   she shut it quickly  there was no room for the actual presence of the boy in the professor s four wheeler   they lunched at a dep t of the aerated bread company  close to cannon street station  while christobel was struggling with a very large plateful of cold tongue  she suddenly remembered that one of the boy s many plans had been to take her to lunch at his favourite restaurant in piccadilly  where she would be able to order any dish she fancied  and find it better served than she had ever known it before  or to dine at the hotel metropole  where monsieur delma s perfect orchestra would play for her any mortal thing for which she chose to ask  and play it better than she had ever heard it played   these memories  and a really excellent cup of coffee  helped christobel in her struggles with the round of cold tongue  and she looked across the little marble topped table brightly at the professor  and spoke with a cheerful hopefulness which surprised herself   but something  other than his own plate of cold tongue  seemed weighing on the professor  he had become preoccupied and distrait   when they reached the folkestone train  christobel found out the cause of his preoccupation    my dear ann i should say christobel   remarked the professor  hurriedly  as he put her into an empty compartment  and hesitated in the doorway   i am always accustomed at this hour to have my pipe and a nap  should you object  my dear ann er that is  christobel  if i sought a smoking compartment     oh  please do   she exclaimed  eagerly  the idea of two hours of freedom and solitude suddenly seemed an undreamed of joy   don t  think of me  i am quite happy here     i will provide you with a paper   said the professor  and hailed a passing boy  he laid the paper on her lap  and disappeared   the train started   christobel looked out of the window as they slowly steamed across the bridge over the thames  she loved the flow of the river  with its constant procession of barges  dredges  boats  and steamers  a silent  moving highway  right through the heart of the noisy whirl of london street traffic  they ran past old st  saviour s church  now promoted to be southwark cathedral  out through the suburbs  until streets became villas  woods and meadows appeared  and the train ran through chislehurst peaceful english resting place where lie entombed the bright imperial hopes of france then on through sevenoaks  into the bowery green of the kentish hop gardens   after passing sevenoaks  she took up the professor s paper and glanced at it  somehow she had felt sure it would be the daily graphic  it was the daily mirror  she had never held a halfpenny illustrated paper in her hands before  no doubt it was an excellent paper  and met the need of an immense number of people  to whom an additional halfpenny a day would be a consideration  but  that the professor  when providing her with one paper  should have chosen a halfpenny instead of a penny paper  seemed to hold a curious significance  and called up sudden swift memories of the boy  he would have bought punch  the graphic  the illustrated  the spectator  and a morning post  plumped them all down on the seat in front of her  then sat beside her  and talked  the whole journey through  so that she would not have had a moment in which to open one of them    oh  boy dear  don t  look at this daily mirror  you might misjudge the good professor  with your fifty thousand a year  how can you be expected to understand a mind which must consider ha pence  even when brides and wedding journeys are concerned  do keep away  boy dear  this is not your wedding journey    then she opened the daily mirror  and there looked out at her  from its central page  the merry  handsome  daring face of her own little boy blue   he was seated in his flying machine  steering wheel in hand  looking out from among many wires  his cap was on the back of his head  his bright eyes looked straight into hers  his firm lips  parted in a smile  seemed to be saying   i jolly well mean to do it   beneath was an account of him  and a description of the flight he was to attempt on that day  across the channel  circling round boulogne cathedral  and back  he was to start at two o clock  at that very moment he must be in mid air   oh  little boy blue  little boy blue  you have a way of making hearts stand still   the boarding house proved to be a place decidedly conducive to the taking of a fresh air cure  because nobody remained within its four walls  if the weather could possibly admit of their going out   as soon as christobel and the professor had taken tea  and replied to miss slinker s many questions  they went out to walk on the leas until sunset  it was a radiant afternoon  and the strong wind which had suddenly arisen  blowing  in unexpected gusts  from the sea  acted as a tonic to weary heart and brain  christobel  holding on her hat as she walked  battled her way beside the professor  up a cross street  into the sandgate road   there they went to the telegraph office  and sent miss ann news of their safe arrival  and of the extreme comfort they felt sure of experiencing at miss slinker s delightful abode   this was the professor s wording    they looked in at parson s library just to order a book miss ann wanted  and  on a little farther  just to match some crewel silks for a tea cosy miss ann was making   these commissions duly executed  they were free to make their way to the leas parade  whence they would look down upon the beach  and enjoy a distance view across the channel  they took the side street which brought them out upon the esplanade  close to the lift by which people continuously mounted or descended the steep face of the cliff   a considerable crowd lined the esplanade railing  looking over eagerly  apparently there was some object of particular interest to be seen below   christobel and the professor advanced to the railing  and also looked over   she saw a strange thing floating in the sea  between the promenade pier and the harbour  it seemed a huge insect  with broken wings  its body was a mass of twisted wires  around this  a little fleet of rowing boats had gathered  they looked black  on the blue wind swept waters  like water boatmen on a village pond  they darted in and out and round about the wreckage of the huge wings and twisted wire  and seemed waiting for a chance to help   a man stood next to christobel and the professor  a man who talked to himself    ah  poor chap   he said   poor chap  so nearly back  so nearly broke the record  such a sport     what is that thing in the water   inquired the professor   the man turned and looked at him    an aeroplane   he said  slowly  speaking with a sort of stolid deliberation   a wrecked aeroplane  caught in a cross current  worse luck  just accomplished one of the finest flights on record  started from up here  skimmed over the channel to boulogne  circled round the cathedral such a clear day  we could watch the whole flight with field glasses came gaily back without a stop  was making for the cliff again  when a cross current caught him  something went wrong with the steering gear  and down it goes  with a plunge  head first into the sea     and the er occupant   inquired the professor    the aeronaut  ah  he didn t  fall clear  worse luck  or they could soon have fished him out  he stuck to his seat and his wheel  and fell smash in among his wires  they are trying to extricate him now  bad luck  poor chap  such a sport     do you know his name   asked the professor  peering down at the waiting crowd which lined the beach    guy chelsea   said the man   and i give you my word  he was the finest  pluckiest young amateur we had among the airmen    then christobel s heart began to beat again  and her limbs seemed to regain the power to move    he is mine   she said   i must go to him  he is my own little boy blue   and she began to run along the leas toward the stone steps which zigzag down to the shore   she heard the professor running after her    ann   he called   ann  stay  this is most unnecessary    she flew on    at least take the lift   bawled the professor   she hurried on and reached the steps  pausing an instant to glance back   the professor had stopped at the lift  and was waving to her with his umbrella   she could never remember running down those steps  in what seemed but a moment from the time she reached them  she found herself stumbling painfully down the steep slope of shingle to the water s edge   the lift  bearing the professor  had just begun to crawl down the face of the cliff  she could see him gesticulating through the glass windows   the crowd on the shore  chiefly composed of rough men  was thickest round the base of a wide stone breakwater  jutting out into the sea  on this break water stood an empty stretcher  a coast guardsman marched up and down  keeping the crowd off the breakwater   christobel reached the outskirts of the crowd  and could get no farther    please let me through   she said   i belong to him  he is mine    they turned and looked at her    she s  is mother   said a voice   let  er through     mother be blowed   said another voice  hoarsely   get out  she s  is wife     yes   she cried eagerly   yes  oh  do let me through  i am his wife    suddenly she knew it was true  the boy s great love had made her his wife  had he not said   you and i are one  christobel  eternally  indissolubly one  you will find it out  when it is too late    the crowd parted  making a way for her  straight to the foot of the breakwater   she mounted it  and walked towards the empty stretcher   the coast guardsman confronted her    he is mine   she said  quietly   i have the right to be here    the man saluted  in respectful silence   she stood gazing out to where the crowd of boats hovered about the great insect with broken wings   the sea gleamed golden in the sunset   one boat  larger than the rest  slowly detached itself from the general mel e  pulling with measured stroke toward the breakwater   something lay very still in the bow  covered with a sail cloth   two coast guardsmen rowed  one steered   the boat came toward the breakwater  in a shaft of sunlight   christobel turned to the man beside her    is there any hope   she asked     fraid not  lady  my mate just signalled  all u p     ah   she said  looking wide eyed into his face   ah  but there must be pioneers    the coast guardsman turned and walked toward the crowd    she s  is wife  men   he said  with a jerk of his thumb over his shoulder   she s  is wife  yet when i told her it was all u p  she said   there must be pioneers     the crowd of roughs doffed their caps   the boat drew slowly nearer   then she saw the professor  hurrying down the shingle  waving his umbrella   he must not come yet   she advanced to the shore end of the breakwater  and spoke to the crowd    please   she said   oh  please  if possible  prevent that gentleman from reaching the breakwater    they turned  and saw the advancing figure of the professor  flurried and irate     ullo  bill   cried a voice   she says  don t  let the old bloke through    they passed the word from one to the other   don t  let the old bloke through   they closed the outer ranks  standing shoulder to shoulder  the professor s umbrella waved wildly on the outskirts   she moved along the breakwater  yes  that was it   don t  let the old bloke through   she had never used such a word in her life before  but it just met the needs of the case   don t  let the old bloke through    the boat drew nearer   a bugle  away up on the cliff  sounded the call to arms    little boy blue  come blow me your horn  the cow s in the meadow  the sheep  in the corn  where is the boy who looks after the sheep  ah  dear god  where is the boy  where is the boy  where is the boy  he s under the sailcloth fast asleep    the boat drew nearer  she could hear the measured plash of the oars  the rhythmic rattle of the rowlocks  they advanced  to the beat of the words in her brain    there must be pion eers  don t  let the old bloke through  oh  where is the boy who looks after the sheep  he s under the sail cloth  fast asleep    the boat drew level with the breakwater  grating against it    under the sail cloth  boy dear  under the sail cloth fast asleep    tenderly  carefully  they lifted their burden  as the boat rocked  and their feet shuffled beneath the weight  she closed her eyes  when she opened them once more  the quiet thing under the sail cloth lay upon the stretcher  every man within sight stood silent and bareheaded   the bugle on the cliff sounded   lights out    the golden shaft of sunlight died from off the sea   then she came forward  and knelt beside her boy   suddenly she understood the cry of anguish wrung from the loving heart of a woman at a tomb   tell me where thou hast laid him  and i will take him away   oh  faithful heart of woman  alike through all the ages  ready  with superhuman effort  to prove a limitless love and a measureless grief   she knelt beside the stretcher  and lifted the sail cloth   yes  it was the boy her own little boy blue   his curly hair was matted with blood and salt water  there was a deep gash across his temple  from the ear  right up into the hair his eyes were closed  but his lips smiled  triumphant   there must be pioneers  every good life given  advances the cause    yes  little boy blue  but has it ever struck you  that  if you marry  your wife will most probably want you to give up flying  not being able to bear that a man who was her all  should do these things   she lifted the sail cloth quite away  and stood looking down upon him  so shattered  yet so beautiful  in his triumphant sleep   suddenly her arm was seized from behind  she turned   the professor had succeeded in pushing his way through the crowd  and in mounting the breakwater  his cravat was awry  his top hat was on the back of his head  he looked at her through his glasses  in amazed indignation    christobel   he said   this is no place for you  come away at once  do you hear  i bid you come with me at once    the only thing she really minded was that his hat was on  in the presence of her dead   she could not free her arm from the grip of the professor   she turned and pointed to the stretcher  with her left hand    my place is here   she said  clearly and deliberately   i have the right to be here  this is all a fearful nightmare  from which we are bound before long to wake  but meanwhile  i tell you plainly as i ought to have told you before this is the body of the man i love    at that moment  one of the crowd  springing on to the breakwater behind the professor  struck off his hat with a cane  it fell into the sea   the professor let go her arm  and turned to see who had perpetrated the outrage  and whether the hat could be recovered   then she bent over the stretcher    boy dear   she whispered  in tones of ineffable tenderness   this is where they have laid you  but i will take you away    she put her arms beneath the body  then  with an almost superhuman effort  lifted it  and gathered it to her  it felt limp and broken  the head fell heavily against her breast  the blood and salt water soaked through her thin muslin blouse  but she held him  and would not let him go   i will take him away   she whispered   i will take him away    she knew she was losing her reason  but she had known that  ever since she first looked down from the top of the cliff  and saw the broken wings floating on the sea  now  with her boy in her arms  her one idea was to get away from the professor  away from the coast guardsmen  away from the crowd   turning her back upon the beach  she staggered along the breakwater  toward the open sea    i will take him away   she repeated   i will take him away    then her foot slipped  she still held the boy  but she felt herself falling   she closed her eyes   she never knew which she struck first  the stone breakwater  or the sea      the seventh day  the stone is rolled away  when christobel recovered consciousness and opened her eyes  she found herself in bed  in her own room  at home   martha bent over her   the morning light entered dimly  through closed curtains   in dumb anguish of mind  she looked up into martha s grim old face    tell me where you have laid him   she said   and i will take him away    martha snorted    i ve  laid your tea tray on the table beside your bed  miss   she said   and when you  ave finished with it  i will take it away    whereupon  martha lumbered to the large bow window  drew back all the curtains with a vigorous clatter of brass rings  and let in a blaze of morning sunshine   christobel lay quite still  trying to collect her thoughts   one of her pillows was clasped tightly in her arms   she lifted her left hand  and looked at it   no ring encircled the third finger    martha   she called  softly   martha loomed large at the side of the bed    what is to day     wednesday  miss   replied martha  too much surprised to be contemptuous    martha where is mr  chelsea     lord only knows   said martha  tragically    martha is he living     living   repeated martha  deliberately  then she smiled  her crooked smile   living don t  express it  miss christobel  lively s more like it  when mr  guy is concerned  and i reckon  wherever  e is  e s makin  things lively somewhere for somebody  you don t  look quite the thing this morning  miss  sit up and take your tea    she sat up  loosing the pillow out of her arms the pillow which had been  first her little boy blue  as she drew him to her in the darkness  then the dead body of guy chelsea  as she lifted it on the breakwater   she took her tea from martha s hand  and drank it quickly  she wanted martha to go   it was wednesday  then the boy had left her only the day before yesterday  his telegram had come last night  the professor s proposal had not yet reached her   martha lifted the tray and departed   then christobel charteris rose  and stood at her open window  in the morning sunlight  she looked out upon the mulberry tree and the long vista of soft turf  in the dim distance  the postern gate in the old red wall his paradise  and hers   she lifted her beautiful arms above her head  the loose sleeves of her nightdress fell away  baring them to the elbows  she might have stood  in her noble development of face and form  for a splendid statue of hope and praise    ah  dear god   she breathed   is it indeed true  is it possible  is my boy alive  and am i free free to be his alone  am i free to give him all he wants  free to be all he needs    she stood long at the window motionless  realizing the mental adjustment which had come to her during the strenuous hours of the night   her dream had taught her one great lesson  that under no circumstances whatever  can it be right for a woman to marry one man  while with her whole being she loves another  love is lord of all  love reigns paramount  no expectations  past or present  based on friendship or gratitude  no sense of duty or obligations of any kind could make a marriage right  if  in view of that marriage  love had to stand by with broken wings   she felt quite sure  now  that she could never marry the professor  and humbly she thanked god for opening her eyes to the wrong she had contemplated  before it was too late   but there still remained the difficult prospect of having to disappoint a man she esteemed so highly  a man who had been led to believe she cared for him  and had waited years for him  a man who  for years  had set his heart upon her  this was a heavy stone  and it lay right in the path of perfect bliss which she longed to tread with her little boy blue   who should roll it away   could she feel free to take happiness with the boy  if she had disappointed and crushed a deeply sensitive nature which trusted her   she dressed  and went down to the breakfast room  her soul filled  in spite of perplexities  with a radiance of glad thanksgiving   martha and jenkins came in to prayers  martha had now taken to curling all her wisps  she appeared with many frizzled ringlets  kept in place by invisible pins   martha always came in to prayers  as if she were marching at the head of a long row of men and maids  jenkins followed meekly  placing his chair at what would have been the tail of martha s imaginary retinue  according to the triumphant dignity of martha s entry  jenkins placed his chair near or far away  martha was in great form to day  jenkins sat almost at the door  if the door bell rang during prayers  the first ring was tacitly ignored  but if it rang again  martha signed to jenkins  who tiptoed reverently out  and answered it  no matter how early in the morning s devotions the interruption occurred  jenkins never considered it etiquette to return  miss charteris used to dread a duet alone with martha  she always became too intensely conscious of herself and of martha  to be uplifted as usual by the inspired words of bible and prayer book  the presence of jenkins at once constituted a congregation   on this particular morning  no interruptions occurred   the portion for the day chanced to be the scene at the empty tomb  in the early dawn of that first easter day  as given by saint mark   the quiet voice vibrated with unusual emotion as miss charteris read     and very early in the morning  the first day of the week  they came unto the sepulchre at the rising of the sun  and they said among themselves  who shall roll us away the stone from the door of the sepulchre  and when they looked  they saw that the stone was rolled away  for it was very great     christobel charteris paused  she seemed to see the shore at dovercourt  and the brave little figure struggling to carry the heavy stone  and  later on when the cannon ball lay safely in the castle court yard  little boy blue standing erect  with lifted cap  and shining eyes  a picture of faith triumphant    i have prayed for thee  that thy faith fail not    how far were the happenings of this strange night owing to that dead mother s prayers  and to the boy s unfailing faith  even through these hard days   miss charteris could read no farther  she closed the bible   let us pray   she said  and turned to the collect for the week     o god  whose never failing providence ordereth all things both in heaven and earth  we humbly beseech thee to put away from us all hurtful things  and to give us those things which be profitable for us  through jesus christ our lord  amen    on the breakfast table  beside her plate  lay the professor s letter  she had known it would be there   she poured out her coffee and buttered her toast   then she opened the letter     my dear ann    after the nightmare through which she had just passed  this beginning scarcely surprised her  she glanced back at the envelope to make quite sure it was addressed to herself  then read on  it was dated the evening before  from the professor s rooms in college     my dear ann  i regret to have been unable to look in upon you this evening  on my return from town  and my duties will keep me from paying you a visit until to morrow  in the late afternoon  hence this letter    needless to say  i have been thinking over  carefully  the remarkable statement you saw fit to make to me  concerning the feelings and expectations of our young friend  it came to me as a genuine surprise  i have always looked upon our friendship as purely platonic  based entirely upon the intellectual enjoyment we found in pursuing our classical studies together    i admit  i cannot bring myself to contemplate matrimony with much enthusiasm    at the same time  your feeling in the matter being so strong  and my sense of gratitude toward my late friend  a thing never to be forgotten  if you are quite sure  ann and i confess it seems to me altogether incredible that our young friend entertains  toward me  feelings which will mean serious disappointment to her  if i fail     this brought the letter to the bottom of the first page   without reading any farther  miss charteris folded it  and replaced it in the envelope   the indignant blood had mounted to the roots of her soft fair hair  but already  in her heart  sounded a song of wondering praise     and when they looked  they saw that the stone was rolled away  for it was very great     the iron gate of the front garden swung open  hurried steps flew up the path  emma  poor soul  had been told to fly  and emma had flown  she almost fell into the arms of jenkins  as he opened the hall door   the note with which emma had run  at a speed which was now causing her  such a stitch as never was   came from miss ann  and was marked  urgent  and  immediate    the corners of christobel s proud mouth curved into a quiet smile as she took it from the salver  she had expected this note    take emma downstairs  jenkins   she said   ask martha to give her a cup of coffee  and an egg  if she fancies it  tell emma  i wish her to sit down comfortably and rest  the answer to this note will be ready in about half an hour  not before    miss charteris finished her coffee and toast  poured out a fresh cup  and took some marmalade  she did not hurry over her breakfast   when she had quite finished  she rose  and walked over to the writing table  she sat down  opened her blotter  took paper and envelopes  found a pen  and tried it   then she opened miss ann s letter  marked  urgent  and  immediate      sweetest child   wrote miss ann   see what kenrick has done  we you and i so understand his dear absent minded ways  he wrote this letter to you last night  and  owing to his natural emotion and tension of mind  addressed it to me  needless to say  i have read only the opening sentences  darling christobel  you will  i feel sure  overlook the very natural mistake  and not allow it in any way to affect your answer to my brother s proposal  remember how difficult it is for great minds to be accurate in the small details of daily life  i have known kenrick to put two spoonfuls of mustard into a cup of coffee  stir it round  and drink it  quite unaware that anything was wrong i have indeed  see how our dear professor needs a wife    i feel quite foolishly anxious this morning  do send me one line of assurance that all is well  you cannot but be touched by my brother s letter  from beginning to end  it breathes the faithful devotion of a lifetime  do not misunderstand the natural reticence of one wholly unaccustomed to the voicing of sentiment  i only wish you could hear all he says to me     then followed a few prayers and devout allusions to providence which brought a stern look to the face of miss charteris and  with a whiff of effusive sentiment  ann harvey closed her epistle   an open letter from the professor to herself was enclosed  but this  christobel quietly laid aside   she took pen and paper  and wrote at once the note for which emma waited     dear ann  i enclose a letter from your brother which came  addressed to me  this morning  but was evidently intended for you  i have read only the first page  which was quite sufficient to make the true state of affairs perfectly clear to me    providence has indeed interposed  by means of the professor s absent minded ways  to prevent the wrecking of three lives mine  your brother s  and that of the man i love  to whom i shall be betrothed before the day is over    i shall not tell the professor that i have seen a portion of his letter to you  i think we owe it to him not to do so  he has always been a true and honourable friend to me    yours   c  c    when emma had duly departed with this letter and enclosure  miss charteris breathed more freely  she had been afraid lest  in her righteous indignation  in her consciousness of the terrible mischief so nearly wrought  she should write too strongly to miss ann  thus causing her unnecessary pain   it was quite impossible  to the fine generosity of a nature such as that of christobel charteris  really to understand the mean  self centred  unscrupulous dishonesty of an action such as this of miss ann s  from the calm heights whereon she walked  such small minded selfishness of motive did not come within her field of vision  she could never bring herself to believe worse of miss ann than that  in some incomprehensible way  she had laboured under a delusion regarding herself and the professor   miss ann disposed of  she turned to the professor s letter   it was not the letter of her dream  by any means  nor was it the letter she had sometimes dreamed he would write   it was straightforward and simple  and  holding the key to the situation  she could read between the lines a certain amount of dismayed surprise  which made her heartily sorry for her old friend   the professor touched on their long friendship  his regard for her parents  his sincere admiration for herself  their unity of interests and congeniality of tastes  his sudden change of fortunes  quoted a little greek  a little sanskrit  and a little persian  then  fortified by these familiar aids to the emotions  offered her marriage  in valiant and unmistakable terms   christobel s heart stood still as she realized that not one word in that letter would have revealed to her the true state of the case  truly  under providence  she had cause to bless the professor s  dear absent minded ways    as she took pen and paper to reply to his letter  her heart felt very warm toward her old friend  she gave him full credit for the effort with which he had done what he had been led to consider was the right thing toward her     my dear professor   she wrote    i rejoice to hear of your good fortune  it is well indeed when the great thinkers of the world are rendered independent of all anxious taking of thought as to what they shall eat  or what they shall drink  or wherewithal they shall be clothed  i like to think of you  my friend  as now set completely free from all mundane cares  able to give your undivided attention to the work you love    i appreciate  more than i can say  the kind proposition concerning myself  which you make in your letter  i owe it to our friendship to tell you quite frankly that i feel  and have long felt  how great an honour it would be for any woman to be in a position so to administer your household as to set you completely free for your great intellectual pursuits    but marriage would mean more than this  and our long friendship emboldens me to say that i should grieve to see you owing perhaps to pressure or advice from others burden your life with family ties for which you surely do not yourself feel any special inclination    and  now  my friend  i must not close my letter without telling you how great a happiness has come into my lonely life  i am about to marry a man whom   miss charteris paused  and looked through the open window to the softly moving leaves of the old mulberry tree  a gleam of amusement shone in her eyes  curving her lips into a tender smile  the boy seemed beside her  slapping his knee and rocking with merriment at the way she was about to bewilder miss ann and the professor  a man whom i have known and loved for over twenty years    i am sure you will wish me joy  dear professor    believe me  always   gratefully and affectionately yours   christobel charteris    she rang the bell  and sent the answer to the professor s letter  by jenkins  she could not wait for the slow medium of the post  she could not let him remain another hour in the belief that  in order to save her from disappointment  he was compelled to marry christobel charteris   she stood at the breakfast room window  and watched jenkins as he hurried down the garden with the note  going by the lane  and taking a short cut across the fields  he would reach the professor s rooms in a quarter of an hour  until then  life was somewhat intolerable   the proud blood mantled again over the face  the strong sweet beauty of which the boy so loved  her letter to the professor had not been easy to write  she had had to be true to herself  and true to him  in the light of what she knew to be his real feeling in the matter  bearing in mind that before long he would almost certainly learn from miss ann that she had replied to his proposal after having read his sentiments on the subject  so candidly expressed on the first page of his letter to his sister   to relieve her mind  after this intricate whirl of cross correspondence  she took up the daily graphic  and opened it  casually turning the pages   suddenly there looked out at her from the central page  the merry  handsome  daring face of her own little boy blue  he was seated in his flying machine steering wheel in hand  looking out from among many wires  his cap was on the back of his head  his bright eyes looked straight into hers  his firm young lips  parted in a smile  seemed to say   i jolly well mean to do it   it was the very picture she had seen in the professor s daily mirror  in her dream of the night before  below was an account of the flight from folkestone which he was about to attempt   then she remembered  with a shock of realization  that the flight across the channel  round boulogne cathedral and back  was to take place on that very day  his telegram  of the night before  had said   i am going to do a big fly to morrow  wish me luck   ah  what if it ended as she had seen it end in her dream  great broken wings  a mass of tangled wire  and the boy her boy with matted hair  and wounded head  asleep beneath the sailcloth   her heart stood still   with their perfect joy so near its fulfilment  she could not let him take the risk  was there time to stop him   she looked at the paper  the start was for   p m  it was now eleven o clock   she remembered his last words   when you want me and send why  i will come from the other end of the world    she never quite knew how she reached the telegraph office  it seemed almost as dreamlike as her flight from the top to the bottom of the folkestone cliffs  but it was not a dream this time  it was desperate reality   why do people always break the points of the pencils hanging from strings in the telegraph offices  surely it is possible to write a telegram without stubbing off the pencil  and leaving it in that condition  for the next person in a hurry   she flew from compartment to compartment  and at last produced her own pencil  and wrote her telegram in the final section of the row  independent of official broken points     do not fly to day  come to me  i want you    christobel     she addressed it to the hotel from which he had telegraphed on the previous day  but added to the address   if not there  send immediately to aviation sheds   she had no idea what to call the places  but this sounded well  and seemed an intuition  or an unconscious recollection of some remark of the boy s   she handed it over the counter   please see that it goes through at once   she said   the clerk knew her   yes  miss charteris   he replied  he began reading the message aloud  but almost immediately stopped  and checked the words off silently  he glanced at the clock   it should be there before noon  miss charteris   he said   he did not look at her  as he passed her the stamps  he had long thought her one of the finest women who stepped in and out of the post office  he had never expected to see her hands tremble  and fancy any woman even she being able to tell guy chelsea not to fly  he had a bet on  about that flight  with an enthusiastic backer of chelsea s  he was glad he had taken the odds against its coming off  before seeing this wire  but after all  it is easy enough to ask a chap not to fly  but   he took up a copy of the daily mirror  and looked at the brave smiling face   i jolly well mean to do it   the young aeronaut seemed to be saying  the clerk laughed  and shook his head   hurry up that wire   he called to the operator  then he jingled the loose change in his pockets   i wonder   he said   during the hours which followed  christobel charteris knew suspense   perhaps that strong  self contained nature could never have fully sounded the depths of its own surrender  without those hours of uncertainty  when nothing stood between her and the man she loved  but the possibility that her telegram would fail to reach him  that he would carry out his dangerous flight  that disaster and death would overtake him and wrest him from her  and that he would die guy chelsea would die without ever knowing of the cup of bliss she was now ready  with utterly loving hand  to hold to his lips   having sent her message  there was nothing more she could do  and the burden of inaction seemed almost too great a weight to carry  during the hours which must elapse  before his coming could turn uncertainty into assurance  restlessness  into peace   it did not occur to her  as a possibility  that guy chelsea would elect to fly  after receiving her request  she knew her slightest wish would be law to the boy s tender loyalty  and though he knew nothing of her cause for anxiety  nor of the complete change of circumstances since he left her  not forty eight hours before  she felt sure he would not fly  she felt certain he would come if if the message reached him in time   at two o clock it came to her  with overwhelming certainty  that her message had not reached him  and that he had started on his flight  she seemed to see the great wings mounting mounting  then skimming over the sea  she almost heard the hum he had so often described the hum of the giant insect on which the bird man flew   her own little boy blue was flying through space  o god  what might not any minute be bringing  he had said   one never expects those things to happen  and when they do happen  it s over so quickly that there is no time for expectation   was it happening now  was it going to be over so quickly  that her cup of bliss would be dashed from her lips untasted  was she to lose her all  because of a cross current or a twisted wire   she was walking up and down the garden now  and paused beside the chair in which she had sat when he had said  only seven days ago   it was always you i wanted  not your niece  good heavens  how can you have thought it was mollie  when it was you you just only you  all the time   and she  half laughing at him  had asked   is this a proposal     my all   she said   oh  boy dear  my all  if i lose you  i lose my all    she walked on slowly  moving to the repetition of those words  it seemed a comfort to repeat the great fact that  at last  he was this to her  surely it would reach him  by some sort of wireless telegraphy through space  surely it would control cross currents  keep propellers acting as they should  steering gear from twisting    o god  he is my all he is my all    the afternoon sun began to glint through the trees   the jolly little  what d  you call  ems  lifted pale anxious faces to the sky   clocks all around chimed the hour of four   suddenly her limbs weakened  she could walk no longer   she sank into a chair  beneath the mulberry tree   in a few minutes jenkins would bring out tea  would martha have arranged a tea such as the boy loved  with cups for two  hot buttered toast and explosive buns   what a boy he was  at heart this man who had won her  what a gay  laughter loving boy   she lay back  very still  under the mulberry tree  and lived again through each of the boy s days  from the first to the sixth   she kept her eyes closed  the sunlight  glinting through the mulberry leaves  fell in bright patches on her white gown  and on her soft golden hair   the garden was very still  all nature seemed waiting with the heart that waited    little boy blue  come blow me your horn     i shall blow it all right on the seventh day   the boy had said   and when i do  you will hear it    this was the seventh day    suddenly the horn of a motor tooted loudly in the lane   she rose  her hands clasped upon her breast  and stood waiting  a shaft of golden sunlight streamed down the garden  and seemed to focus on the postern gate   then the gate swung open and the boy came in  slamming it behind him  she saw him coming up the lawn toward her  bareheaded  the sunlight in his shining eyes    i couldn t  wait for trains   he shouted   i came by motor  and i jolly well exceeded the speed limit all the way    she moved a few steps to meet him    boy dear   she said   you always exceed all speed limits  it is a way you have  exceed them as much as you like  so long as i am with you when you do it  but oh  my little boy blue  don t  fly again  for  if you fall and break your wings  indeed you will break my heart    in a moment she was sobbing on his breast  her arms flung around him  there was nothing broken or limp about his strong young body  pulsating with life   he put his arms about her  holding her in a clasp of close possessive tenderness   he did not yet understand what had happened  but he knew the great gift he desired had been given him  he waited for her to speak   she lifted her face to his    guy   she said   ah  take me  hold me  keep me  i am altogether your own  i will explain to you fully  by and by  the stone was very great  but lo  as we reached it  the angel of the lord had rolled it away     no other man has a shadow of claim over me  i am free to say  to the only man i have ever really loved  take me  i am yours  oh  boy  i am altogether yours    he bent over her   the sweet proud lips were parted in utter surrender  and lifted to his   he paused just for one exquisite moment  of realization   she waited his kiss with closed eyes  so she did not see the radiance of his face  as he looked up to the blue sky  flecked with fleeting white clouds  but she heard the voice  which from that hour was to make the music of her life    thank the lord   said little boy blue   then he kissed her    and the evening and the morning were the seventh day    '"
